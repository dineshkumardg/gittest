          <essay:p>Address by the Chilean Foreign Minister, Senor Clodomiro Almeyda, delivered at Chatham House, 5th* June, 1972* It is for the Government of Chile a distinction and for myself an honour to have &quot;been invited to this meeting which gathers, in this Royal Institute of International Affairs, representative personalities of the academic community, industry, commercial and banking activities, and journalists specialized in Latin American affairs. This high tribune provides me with a valuable opportunity to talk in a direct and frank manner on some aspects of my country&apos;s foreign policy&#174; Political communities live under the impact of certain vital interests that project emotional reactions and rational beliefs, which are crystallized into social values and perfected into common objectives. All of them possess aspirations endowed with certain permanence and vigour, being the fruit of the historic process of each people and the development of its economic and social structures. Quite independently of her size and capabili&#172; ties as a State, every nation requires, to attain her international objectives, a sense of unity in her common destiny. Such unity, in its highest degree, can only originate within a force of deep popular content, intensely committed to the historic struggles of the people, to their suffering and their ideals* It is a very simple truth that the effective possibi&#172; lity of implementing a genuine foreign policy, independent and dynamic, is strongly qualified by the forms of popular participation in the inception, in the administration and in the periodical revision of the fundamental guidelines of that policy&#174; However, this truth is reflected in many ways in the design of Chile&apos;s international policy and in</essay:p>

We have also strengthened our relations with the countries of the Andean Pact, specially Peru, Colombia and Ecuador, whose govern&#172; ments invited President Allende to a successful visit of their countries&#8226; The visit of the President of Mexico to Chile, last April, was a significant expression of support to the Chilean foreign policy of recuperation of our basic resources and to our fight against imperialism&#174; We have put the foundations of a historic cooperation with the Socia&#172; list countries; we have reinforced and emphasized our economic links with Japan and Western Europe, fostering a policy of mutually advantageous understandings* Finally, we have succeeded in making the scope of our internal effort fully understood, thereby obtaining support for our request of renegotiation of the external debt&#174; Because we oppose blocks and we favour an overall system of collective security, Chile became officially a member last year of the Group of Non Aligned countries and has the firm intention of carrying an active participation in its meetings held under the principles and ends con&#172; tained in the Chart of the Lusaka Conference&#187; We are faith ful members, since its creation, of the United Nations and we cooperate with enthusiasm in all her organizations&#174; We participate in every meeting of the regional organism of our hemisphere, the Organization of American States, but we have pointed very frankly that it must reform itself to put an end to two mistaken assumptions: that there is an identity of interests between the United States and Latin America and that there can be juridical equality among its members, that is the most rich country of the</essay:p>
