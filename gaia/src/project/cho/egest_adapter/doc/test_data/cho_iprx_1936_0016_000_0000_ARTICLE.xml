            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 30 YOSEMITE CONFERENCE SUMMARY Pressing problems of the Pacific area were brought into sharp focus, critically examined and solutions discussed at the Sixth Conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations, held in the Yosemite Valley, August 15-29, 1936. Here delegates from countries bordering the Pacific exchanged views with notable freedom. The outstanding result was the development of a spirit of hope that peaceful solutions may be found for issues that might without wise statesmanship, backed by public opinion^ drift into war. Here scholars, statesmen, and men of affairs from eleven coxn&apos; Iri oeeply perturbed by political unrest, East and West, calmly examined some of vhe out&#172; standing symptoms of disorder, diagnosed both the immediate ailment ov .:he world and its chronic afflictions, and finally o.rrived at an entirely favosa&quot;: le prognosis provided only the patient could be persuaded to give a half-way irrtelj agent cooperation. The occasion was the Sixth Conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations established some ten years ago to study the relations of the Pacific peoplest One of the justifications for optimism was the first appearance as full members of an Institute Conference of representatives from two great nations which can contri&#172; bute much to the adjustment of divergent interests in the Pacific area, France and the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics. Another was the unexpected but obvious determination of all the member groups not to use the occasion, as well they might have done, simply to strengthen the case of their respective countries before such a tribunal of intellectuals and thus to bring it to the consciousness of influential circles throughout the world; but rather to take a new departure in international discussion from a candid and realistic analysis of the soro points between the nations. In this they were aided by the character and reputation of the Institute which is made up of non-official member groups in the various countries represen&#172; tative in each case of the most advanced scholarship, experience in public affairs, and sensitiveness to social needs. This combination of talents and mentalities can, perhaps, best be illustrated by mentioning a fe^^r of those who took a loading part in the Yosemite Park discussions: to start wi&amp;h the two new member groups already named, France sent Albert Sarraut, barely relieved two or three months ago of his responsibility as Prime Minister, a servant of his country, as legislator and administrative official for more than thirty years. Associated with him were the two best known French authorities on Far Eastern affairs and two men intimate&#172; ly acquainted with the economic and political life of Indo-China. The Moscow group had sent Or. V.E. Motylev, economist and geographer, an outstanding figure among Russian social scientists, and associated with him a journalist of inter&#172; national reputation. The Chinese group was led by Dr. Hu Shih whose eminence in letters and in education and whose consistent political philosophy through many yours of changing currents of thought in hi3 own country have ensured a hearing for his</essay:p>

The same categories might also be applied to the strong Japanese group which came under the leadership of Dr. Tadao Yamakawa, a member of the House of Peers, and which included such men as Kenkichi Yoshizawa, also a Peer, who was Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1932 and has held many other posts of distinction; a number of economists and political scientists who have taken part in the researches of the Institute for many years; and men close both to the Government and to influential business circles in Japan, a group which, bocause of the variety of its own affiliations, was able to give the Conference a sense of the diversity of Japanese interests in international questions. The British group was headed by the Rt. Hon, A,V, Alexander, Member of Parliament and Labour Leader &#8212; believed by many to be destined for an even higher post in the next Labour Government of his country than that which he held in the last which ho served as First Lord of the Admiralty, Representative also of many currents of public opinion, the British group was especially strong in persons of long experience in Far Eastern public and private business. The Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands took part through the presence of smaller but distinguished groups in each of which wore men and women internationally known for their contributions to the social sciences or for the part they have played in international politics, Canada, because of its geographical nearness, and the United States, as the host country, had the largest member groups, the former headed by that veteran of international discussion, the Hon, Newton W# Rowell, K.C,, who represented the Dominion at the First Assembly of the League of Nations, in 1920; the latter by Dr. Carl L, Alsberg, a scientist who has won international renown by his studies in the world&apos;s food supplies. What did the 136 members of the Conference talk about? The subject of the Conference, agreed upon three years ago, was &quot;Aims and Results of Social and Economic Policies in Pacific Countries,&quot; The &quot;policies&quot; to be considered were not only those of governments but also those of parties and influential groups. But in order to reduce this vast subject to manageable proportions, preparation and conference discussion was limited, as regards major attention, to four countries: the United States, China, Japan, and the Soviet Union, In each case, the Conference round tables v\rore asked to consider the international implications of recent changes in national economic policy. It was possible to concentrate attention thus on the foreign aspects of what are essentially internal develop&#172; ments because these developments themselves were the subject of a rich documenta&#172; tion which every participant was expccted to have read - at least to the extent of his own interest. Indeed, it would probably be correct to say that no un&#172; official international conference ever has had before it so extensive a collection of data pertinent to the agenda, authoritative as to the facts and scholarly as to interpretation of the facts. Not including several recently published reports of larger Institute studies, there were presented close on sixty of these documents, ranging from brief pamphlets to extensive monographs - the most extensive being the collection from Japan, the most interesting to the Conference members probably that coming from the U,S,S,R., bocause only very few facts about the socialist constructive development in the Far East had been available previously in one of the Western languages. Of course, the reconstruction of China, the economic and strategic expansion policies of Japan, and other topics on the agenda had been the subject of previous Institute studies and, in some cases, of an extensive literature, so that it was possible after a brief review of the facts to proceed to questions of the motives and results of policies, of difficulties encountered in their application, and of their effects on the interests of other countries. As a deliberative body, the Institute of Pacific Relations does not attempt to influence action by governments or other agencies. Nevertheless, both</essay:p>

This is achieved without taking votes and without any attempt to arrive at a tuperficial harmony by driving minority opinions into silence&#174; Starting with nothing more than a common desire to understand a situation and the attitudes held in regard to it, the members net infrequently see ways to overcome difficulties which had not previously occurred to anyone# The present conference was full of such occasions - most notably in the final part of the program which, leaving aside the particular questions facing individual nations, tried to envisage as a whole the changing balance of forces in the Pacific and to examine the possibilities of peaceful adjustment of dif&#172; ferences in national purpose. Throughout the preceding discussions the conviction had grown that the problems of the Pacific are too closely connected with those of other parts of the world to make possible effective separate solutions. This thought was clinched with the phrase: &quot;the peace of the world is indivisible.&quot; Another conviction which grew from the discussions was that security - economic or political - is unattainable for any one nation or group of nations unless it is shared by all. This thought found expression in a prolonged quest of members for the conditions of &quot;collective security.&quot; Third, and considerably slower in maturing because a variety of interpretations gave rise to misgivings as to the exact meaning and possible consequences, was the growth of a belief in &quot;peaceful change.&quot; As national interest was seen to clash upon national interest, the un&#172; welcome fact gradually became clear that only actual sacrifices of national interests, at least on minor points, can sufficiently lessen the strains and stresses of international relations to ensure the world against disturbances a- rising from changed conditions. At first, the question was raised whether &quot;peaceful change&quot; was not simply a compromise between leading powers by which some of them make to others concessions voluntarily instead of having them wrested from them - in such matters as cossion of territory or re-distribution of markets through bilateral or multilateral agree&#172; ments# Such compromises, it was held, if they do not consult interests of the weaker or dependent peoples, may merely transfer the domination over their fortunes, as formerly under the agreements made between dynasties, from one power to another. In the course of a lengthy discussion it was discovered, however, that the chief exponents of the doctrine of &quot;peaceful change&quot; realize the need for drastic re&#172; adjustments, not only between the great powers, but also between the dominant and the dependent or semi-dependent peoples. The sort of peaceful change v;hich would reduce international frictions and lay the basis for international cooperation in the interest of stability and progress, it was admitted, would have to reckon with a gradual rise in the economic, political, and social status of populations which have not in the past played a very active part in the determination either of their own fate or that of intornational relations. This realization was closely connected with yet another one, admitted, it is true, in varying degrees of fullness by the representatives of different nations; that the roots of almost every international conflict lie in some maladjustment within one or more of the countries and imperial systems affected. Thus, the weakness of ^hina, brought about only in part by the decay of an economy not easily integrated in that of modern world interdependence but also in part by a long history of foreign aggression, now is the focus of mutual distrust and apprehension between Pacific nations. Thus also the maldistribution of economic power between</essay:p>

            <essay:p>different classes and groups in countries i/\foich are counted as strong forces in international affairs, often results of former imperialist adventures, give rise to internal difficulties which in turn find vent in disturbances of the respective country*s foreign relations. Examples of this are the lack of consuming power through the great disparity of incomes in such countries as the United States which seek to throw on the world markets products which might well &quot;be absorbed at home if a fair minimum standard of life could be maintained but which, as surplus* in competition with the products of other countries, arc liable to lower world prices to a level at which these commodities can no longer be advantageously produced&#174; Another example is the growth of a surplus population which, in a country like Japan, unable to find buyers for its products in an impoverished^ peasantry, must needs seek outlets either in opportunities for emigration or in opportunities to engage in export industries &#171;&#8226; again loading to a disturbance of friendly international relations as foreign countries raise barriers against the admission of both Japanese immigrants and Japanese products. While most of these problems arc familiar ones, the situation in the Pacific area has greatly changed, it appeared, with the emergence of the Soviet Union as a norr factor to bo reckoned with. Although the U.S.S.R, is almost self- sufficient and needs neither additional territory nor foreign trade to uphold its internal strength, the very fact that it need not compromise its interests to procure advantages abroad is looked upon with misgivings by certain other natiorio. Though in fact it has given many evidences of a desire to participate in the stabilization of international relations and is far less isolationist in its policies than the United States, the noarness of this strong young power^to the chief trouble spots of the Pacific is viewed with alarm by somo because its econ&#172; omy and political system are so different from those of other countries as to make incalculable the lines of policy which they would acquire if one of the neighbors should seriously weaken in its power of resistance. It was realized, especially in the light of the trends which have developed in the course of the recent v/orld economic depression, that even so powerful ana aggressively advanc&#172; ing a country as Japan is fragile in the sense that any new pressures from with&#172; out, or any support from without for tendencies of social division within, might eventually have catastrophic consequences. A majority of the members of the Conference accepted at its face value the statement of representatives of the Soviet Union that their country had no desire to foment trouble abroad - and in this they were upheld by the record of recent years. It was admitted that the example of a successful socialist construction in the U.S.S.R* might be a dis&#172; turbing element in the inner harmony of neighboring countries. The tendency of the Conference to look for the causes of international friction in the mal-distribution of possessions and opportunities both as between nations and as within each nation, was re-inforcod by the contributions to Its discussions of representatives of two great international bodies which have re&#172; cently engaged in searching investigations of those causes, the International Labour Office and the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation. The International Studies Conference of the latter, in fact, is paralleling on a European background the Institute of Pacific Relations&apos; investigations of the part which overpopulation and the uneven distribution of essential food stuffs and industrial and raw materials play in international conflict. As regards the latter problem, the Conference came to the conclusion- somewhat surprising to many of the members &#8212; that after all the outstanding difficulty, at least in times of peace, is not that some nations arc self- sufficient in regard to the raw materials which they require while othors have to seek them in territories under foreign rule; but that it is the inability to pur&#172; chase such materials when quota and tariff barriers prevent the free sale of commodities the returns from which might be offerod in payment.

            <essay:p>light of this conclusion that tho Confcronce paid much attention to possibilities of freeing the clogged channels of international trade. In general, it was felt that where, faced with the necessity of protecting its own industries, a country must place restrictions upon imports of competitive commodities, a system of quotas is more advantageous than one of prohibitive tariff ratesj for, while a quota on imports - whether general or in regard to those from a given country - can be raised or lowered from time to time to admit such quantity of the respective commodity as the country requires and can admit -without danger to its own pro&#172; ducers, a tariff is much less flexible but, a continuing barrier to the degree of its effectiveness in helping industries of little internal vitality to sur- vive0 Another conclusion was that bilateral trade agreements, though sometimes the only practicable first stop to revive an international exchange of commodities, are likely to close channels of trade between the contracting parties and third parties. For this reason, multilateral agreements and those containing a &quot;most- favored-nation1&apos; clause were regarded as more advantageous, usually,for the ro- vival of stagnant international trade. It became clear that the demand of some nations for free access to raw materials essentially has a strategic motivation with a view to possible future wars. The members of the round tables thus faced the dilemma that if they sub&#172; scribed to the view that nations deficient in such essential raw materials as metals, coal, cotton, and chemical substances, should be assured of them either by cession of territories or by special treaties, they tended to strengthen preparedness for war; if, on the other hand, they declared such special adjust&#172; ments unnecessary because in timcs of peace every nation can buy what it can afford to pay for, the grievances in this respect would continue to exist as potent sources, in association with others, of international conflict. For those and other reasons, tho Conference was driven to recognize that all poacemeal readjustments between individual nations are insufficient to dissipate the war cloud which hangs over tho Pacific area as over the rest of the world; and that only a complete change in the trend of national policies from self-protection to trust in agencies of collective peace can produce the pro- requisite conditions for a lasting peace. This, however, requires not only^a strengthening of treaty provisions to make more difficult violations by individual powers; it also requires a change of mentality from fear and distrust to confi&#172; dence and trust in international cooperation. Hence some attention was given also to the place which public opinion must play in strengthening tho forces that make for intcrnational understanding. In this connection it may be stated that in the research program of the Institute which is only in part linked to the preparation for its conferences inquiries into economic causes of mal&#172; adjustment are now being matched in most of the member countries by studios of public opinion on international questions and the part played by the press in influencing that opinion. The Yosomite Conference was the most successful of those held thus far by the Institute of Pacific Relations &#171;&#8226; chiefly because of a much more adequate pre&#172; paration for it on the part of the National member groups and of the International Secretariat than was possible in earlier years. Several of the members who had attended more than one conference declared tliat tho Institute had now, in its tenth year, entered the age of maturity, !/fhile that maturity is still that of young and vigorous manhood rather than of ripe experience, it was felt that the Institute has proved its worthwhileness. It has become accepted in the most influential quarters of many countries as a valuable voluntary and non-official counterpart of the diplomatic machinery.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The Conferences, held every two or throe years, are only one of the Institute&apos;s activitiesj many consider it less important, in fact, than the continuous research work conducted by the member National Councils in accordance with a concerted international program, and the day-by-day diffusion of knowledge from the eleven national offices. Some of these offices are now equipped with extensive research and reference libraries&#174; Several of the National Councils have periodical organs of their own, in addition to the international Institute quarterly, &quot;Pacific Affairs,&quot; All of them have become, for their respective countries or regions - for, in several cases the National Councils conduct their activities through a number of regional branch offices - recognized sources of authoritative information on the peoples and affairs of the Pacific area. No announcement has yet been made where the next Conference is to be held; but there is a considerable demand that again, as in 1929 and in 1931, it shall be in the Far East0 Provision has also been made for more frequent smaller interim conferences for specific purposes between the general conferences of the Institute, The general policy of the Institute is to carry on its work as much as possible through the National Councils, acting to some degree under the direc&#172; tion and with the assistance of the International Secretariat. Privately financed, the Institute thus uses its resources to the largest possible extent in the direct pursuit of its object rather than in the building up of a costly central machinery* There is the less need for the latter in that the Secretariat is largely a peri&#172; patetic one - strengthened in turn by a frequent interchange of national secre&#172; tarial personnel &#171;&#8226; and in that the leading personalities in the various member groups have become internationally linked by such close sense of fellowship in the common task that understanding and cooperation between them is of an un&#172; usually strong and intimate nature. The Yosemite Conference again demonstrated that international under&#172; standing begins with a serious effort to know the thoughts and the worries of the other fellowj and that where mutual knowledge grows, mutual liking follows of itself. NOTE: This summary was prepared by a member of the Conference but this does not imply that it represents the views of all the members of the Conference or of the Institute as a whole.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Do c&quot;amen t 46 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON U.S.A. ROUND TABLE TOPIC I, AUGUST 16, 1935 (Dr. Joseph S &#187; Davis) I interpret, as I think the Program Committee has interpreted, the American Recovery Program broadly to include the whole group of politico-economic measures of the Roosevelt Administration, &quot;beginning with the executive action shortly after the inauguration in March 1933, continuing with the legislation of one hundred days in the special session of Congress, and followed &quot;by a con&#172; siderable number of other executive acts and legislative measures. The recovery objective was prominent in many of these measures, but by no means always dominant. Relief, reform, social experimentation, and political exigency were all involved and sometimes dominant. Moreover, it was a program only in a loose sense. At the outset, certainly, there was nothing like a com&#172; prehensive coherent plan, but rather a combination of schemes urged by persons of differing opinions. Gradually the administration undertook to do more &quot;national planning,&quot; and to work toward something which might be called a &quot;national plan.&quot; But what has thus far evolved has never constituted a compre&#172; hensive integrated plan, nor one primarily devoted to recovery* It is perhaps necessary in our discussions to concentrate more on those parts which relate to recovery, but by no means all of the significant acts with international im&#172; plications were designed as recovery measures. I think we should bear in mind th^t to the formulation and execution of a program of planned economic adjust&#172; ment, including not only those mentioned in the handbook outline, but also those limitations of time and of human capacity. The Administration began its work toward the end of a 12--month&apos;s period including the presidential campaign, in which were reached the depths of severe depression - agricultural industrial, and commercial; and also in a psychological crisis of fear and unrest which found partial reflection in the closing of banks through failure on an increasing scale. It was out of such emergency psychoses that the early emergency program took shape=. It was designed, to meet the psychological crisis and the banking difficulties and, if possible, to reverse the &quot;vicious spiral,&quot; as it was called, of economic recession. Action - boldc. decisive government action, was called for over a wide front. It could not wait on the development of integrated plans. &quot;Do something, &quot; was the watchword, &quot;for God&apos;s sake, do something.&quot; There were consistent efforts, however, to avoid dictatorial methods and to win and maintain the support, not only of Congress but of the public at large. Never before has there been such a large grist of press releases put out by the government, and never before has there been such extensive and effect&#172; ive use of the radio in the interests of government measures.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The early objectives of this policy of action were to raise commodity prices and increase purchasing power. Not only in the early weeks of the ad&#172; ministration, &quot;but again in October, President Roosevelt emphasized his intention to raise the price level from the depths to which it had fallen in the past three years# &quot;Do it we will&quot; he said, &quot;in one way, if not in another&#171;&quot; The increase of purchasing power of the farmers, particularly of the wage earners, was like-&apos; wise considered a primary objective. President Hoover had enunciated the dictum, &quot;We cannot spend ourselves into prosperity.&quot; The new administration replied, in effect: &quot;We shall try to,&quot; and undertook to pour out money on a large scale. The idea was to raise commodity prices and to increase purchasing power, both speedily and substantially. It is of two groups of measures directed toward these objectives that I wish to speak - the monetary policy and the agricultural program The monetary policy was directed toward the first of the general object&#172; ives, raising the level of commodity prices. The first step was to abandon re&#172; demption of currency in gold, and to restrict exports of gold. Then gold in private possesion was called in. Then the purchase of gold at higher and higher prices was adopted. Finally came the president&apos;s action devaluating the dollar in terms of gold. These were deliberate moves, not forced by technical necessity. Those who regard them as a necessity find that necessity in the psychological and economic situation rather than in any technical condition,of the currency. But it was also in the minds of those who were responsible for those moves that we could not merely raise prices thereby, but also institute a reform in the direction of stabilizing price levels - establishing what Professor Fisher called the &quot;stabilized dollar,&quot; what Secretary Wallace had called the &quot;honest dollar,&quot; what the opponents called the &quot;rubber dollar.&quot; The initial moves,were hurriedly made, on the advice of one or two unorthodox advisers. By no means all of the domestic implications were con&#172; sidered; there was not time. To some extent international implications were taken into account, but.they were not given great weight and were not allowed to interfere with what was deemed to be a domestically justified nove to raise the general price level. The results of the monetary policy were too numerous to discuss in full One of the earliest effects was a strong speculative boom, from April to July, 1933. which had a marked influence on our course of development. This boom was quickly followed by severe recession, and this in turn, by new efforts to bring about price advances of a more durable character. With respect to its main objectives, it is safe to say that the gold or currency policy gravely dis&#172; appointed the Administration&apos;s hopes and expectations. Soon the adviser who had strongly urged it disappeared, and the confident assurances that its objects would be achieved were forgotten. The price level, indeed, rose from the depths to which it had fallen, particularly after the adverse weather of 1934 had severely cut the supply of various agricultural products, as well as during 1933-34 when the Nra Was working similarly in the direction of increasing prices. One of the greatest difficulties in appraising the elements of the recovery pro&#172; gram lies in determining their share of responsibility for the factual results to which many factors contributed. So it is with the influence of the monetary policy on the general price level. It is not known to what extent it was the cause of the advance that occurred. Surely it was not completely responsible. The fact remains that the price level today is still well below the level of 1926, which was often referred to as the goal of the policy.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>I turn now to the agricultural program. What was called The Farm Act of 1933, one of the emergency measures of the first hundred days, had three important sections or &quot;titles.&quot; The last of these provided the legislative &quot;basis for the president&apos;s action on the monetary policy, uhus linking the monetary with the agricultural program&#187; Another was the Emergency Farm Credit Act, under which a Farm Credit Administration was set up with broad powers and responsibilities. In the data papers that have &quot;been submitted to you. com&#172; paratively little attention has been given to the Farm Credit Administration# Yet its work in the past three years, in the fields of debt relief, debt re&#172; ad justment, and expansion of credit to farmers, has been carried out on a major scale and has unquestionably contributed greatly to the improvement of the financial position of the farmers* Its real importance, indeed, may have been as large as that of the more spectacular Agricultural Adjustment Administration# The AAA, as we may call its was se^ ^P under the first title of the Farm Act of 1933, called the Agricultural Adjustment Act. It was an outgrowth of prolonged planning (or plotting). Prominent in it, however, was the idea of production control which had come rather recently into the field of agrarian thought. Not until after the 1932 election, indeed, v/ere any of the farm organizations pledged to production control, and it was not even mentioned in Governor Roosevelt&apos;s Topeka speech of September 1932, in which he announced the principles of a farm relief program. One of the main objectives of the AAA was to cut down the production, temporarily at least, of great staples of which we produce an export surplus, in order, particularly, to reduce the supplies which had been carried over and were not readily salable, and to raise prices oi these products both immediately and in the longer run. A second objective was to pour funds promptly into the farmers&apos; hands. In part these were to be paid to induce farmers to curtail their acreage or production, as &quot;rental or benefit payments.&quot; Soon, however, without special provision for it in the Adjustment Act, the &#9632;Administration arranged for heavy loans to the producers of cotton and corn, with the same objective - particularly, in the case of corn growers, where it was found impossible to get benefit payments to them for several months to come. Also supplementing these loans and benefit payments, extensive purchases of various farm products were made by the AAA or the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation,, and these distributed to families on relief. These purchases were made primarily to raise the price of the products concerned, and to speed the flow of the money into the farmers&apos; hands&#8222; but the relief dumping ground was chosen in preference to an ex&apos;port dumping ground. Efforts were made to proceed throughout with the cooperation of the farmers, both in connection with all phases of the programs for adjustment of acreage and production, and even in connection with the loan and surplus purchase schemes. I think we have.never before had such a painstaking effort on the part of the government to proceed with the full knowledge and cooperation of the beneficiaries of the plan. Even when Congress passed two acts, the Bankhead Act and the Kerr-Smith Act, under which coercive taxes were imposed to compel cotton and tobacco growers.to participate in the adjustment plans, this action was not taken until the administration had assurance that the farmers concerned would welcome such action.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Eventually, the production control Measures and the other emergency actions, including the loan and surplus purchase plans, wore gradually converted in the minds of the administration into permanent ones. Without alteration of the emergency sections of the &quot;basic act, what had been purely emergency measures were held to be v; or thy of continuance as part of a permanent policy. Along with this, there were added some other elements of a &quot;planned agriculture,&quot; in&#172; cluding efforts to arrive at a &quot;planned use&quot; of agricultural land# I think it is fair to say that the international implications of the agricultural program, were more fully considered than was the case with many of the other government measures&#8226; Perhaps this was because of the personnel that had the leadership in this program. It was accepted, for example, that the restriction of production would for the time being restrict our export of the products concerned; but it was considered that this was essential in order to meet a changed situation in which foreign countries were less able and willing to buy these products. In no sense and in no case was permanent abandonment of the foreign market- contemplated. In the case of wheat, moreover, the United States sought and got an.international wheat agreement for the regulation of the flow of exports and for the readjustment of the world wheat supply to the world wheat requirements. High hopes were entertained for this and other potential agreements, and it was a great disappointment to the administration when it broke down before the end of the first year. Export subsidies had ior years been urged as a means of aiding farmers, and under other leadership it is quite possible that large~scale experiments with such subsidies would have been adopted. T^e international implications of such subsidies were considered^ objectionable, and the utmost Secretary Wallace permitted to be done in this direction was an export subsidy scheme in 1933&#8212;34 under which 23 million busnels of wheat (in grain and flour) v;ere exported from the Pacific Northwest, nearly half of it to China, under a loan to the Chinese Government. Only recently, in April 1936, was this policy of export subsidies renewed, but then limited only to flour from three Pacific Northwest states to the Philippines. Congress adopted in August, 1935, an amendment - Section 32 of a series of sections amending the Agricultural Adjustment Act - providing for more extensive resort to export subsidies. President Roosevelt in January, 1936, recommended the re&#172; peal of this section. When Congress did not repeal it, but strengthened it^ instead, the Administration made no further objection; but the extent to which export subsidies have been resorted to has been exceedingly limited. So far it constitutes a very minor element in our policy, and little more than a con&#172; cession to congressional demands for some action of this sort. The difficulty of assessing the results of the agricultural program is very large, not only because in the course of its operation there has been some genuine economic recovery in this country and abroad &#8212; to whatever cause that recovery may be ascribed &#8212; but also because the weather has played an especially important part in the past three or four seasons. The droughts of 1934 and 1936, and adverse weather also in 1933 and 1935, played important parts in curtailing production of farm products and raising farm prices and farmer income. The production control program of the Administration really had a major rusulc only in the case of cotton, where the crops of the 3 years, 1933&#8212;35, were perhaps 2djo smaller than they would have been in the absence of any such restrictions. In the case of wheat, almost the entire reduction was to be charged to tne weather and almost none to the AAA. In the case of corn, the responsibility for the reduction was divided between the two, but in two of the three years adverse</essay:p>

In respect to cotton^ most of the price advance that was achieved &quot;as due to the AAA. coujjled with such aid as was given by the monetary policy of the administration* but with. regard to wheat, corn, and hogs, most of the advances were due to the adverse weather conditions. In practically every case except tobacco, however, the price advance fell far short of that which was called the &quot;fair exchange value&quot; or &apos;&#8226; parity&quot; price at which Congress had directed the AAA to aim. It proved, and the AAA soon recognized, that restriction of production in the amount necessary to raise prices to the so-called &quot;parity level&quot; would arouse antagonism from the general public and cause farmers to lose more in volume than they gained thru price advances. Hence the administration recognized that the production control system was a weaker force in the attainment of its objective than it had originally anticipated. Moreover, the production control system under voluntary contracts was in the process of breaking down - not where it was applied with coercive measures, as to cotton, and tobacco, but where the rental and benefit system Y/as relied upon. An increasing amount of wheat was being planted by persons who had not signed contracts with the government. The acreage sown for the crop of 1935 exceeded that of the base period for the entire country, instead of falling 10$ short of it, as the administration had wished. Plans.to make this system permanent were underway, and new contracts were formulated or signed, when the Supreme Court made its adverse decision on January 6, 1936. That decision did not entirely invalidate the agricultural acto It threw out the production control, processing tax, and benefit payment systemj on the .grounds that it invaded the constitutional rights of the states. This was a crippling bio?/, but it did not kill the AAA nor interfere with various other elements in its program. In respect to production control, indeed, this may have been a blessing in disguise to the AAA* It probably averted a disastrous breakdown in the system that was underway. It did force a radical and sudden change in plans but under the new Soil Conservation and Domestic Allottment Act, the AAA is undertaking to go as far as possible in the same direction, while putting great emphasis on the conservation of soil and soil fertility&#174; It seems.likely that this act will not come before the Supreme Court before it is replaced by joint action with the states that is planned to go into effect early in 1938. It is impossible accurately to assess the distribution of burdens and benefits under the agricultural adjustment program. Not all of the benefit pay&#172; ments paid to farmers represented a new addition to their income, though the greater part of it dido The advance in prices was largely offset by the re&#172; duction in volume attributable to the AAA, and the net income of the grower was not particularly enhanced thereby. Of the increased income of farriers during 1933&#8212;35, a large part is due to the recovery that has been experienced in general, part to the accidental effects of adverse weather, and part to the benefit pay&#172; ments and certain official acts of the AAA. Perhaps the AAA contribution may be put in the neighborhood of a billion dollars or somewhat more, for the 3 years under consideration. The burdens were widely distributed but to a considerable extent fell on the great mass of consumers of agricultural products, including farmers, though some part fell on processors and distributors.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 47 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON U.S.A. ROUND TABLE TOPIC I, AUGUST 16, 1936 (Theodore J. Kreps) First I wish to pay passing mention to the silver policy of the Ad&#172; ministration. As you know, early in 1933, the President was authorized to accept limited quantities of silver, computed at $1.29 an ounce, in payment of interest and principal on the war debts, a measure used by Great Britain to make a token payment in 1933, and then droppecl. Then the World Economic Conference brought forth a silver agreement among the countries of the world, which in effect sought to make permanent the status quo. Finally, in June of 1934, the Silver purchase Act made it mandatory upon the Secretary of the Treasury to buy silver in world markets until the metallic base back of our paper currencies consisted one fourth of silver. About 835,000*000 oz. of silver was purchased, the price jumping from 48 cents in June of 1934 to 81 cents in 1935, and falling back to about 45 cents at the present time, for the administration has since last November not pursued its purchase policy with any noticeable degree of vigor. The fact I wish to emphasize concerning silver policy is that accord&#172; ing to the most charitable view one can take of it, it was definitely regarded as a stimulant of foreign trade. Silver producers had long maintained that raising the price of silver would raise the purchasing power of the Orient, indeed, according to some, of the peoples of India as well as China, that is, one-half the population of the world. This view had been thoroughly exploded in serious economic literature, but it found influential exponents in such persons as Dr. Will Burant, and Mr. Robert Brownell of the American Smelting and Refining Corporation. It was apparently these experts to Whom administra&#172; tion circles lent favorable ear. Political representation from the seven silver-producing states no doubt also received a certain amount of consideration. It is not accurate to say that the opinion of experts on the silver question was wholly ignored, however. Early in 1934, a mission was sent to the Orient, but their report was never made public, from which the inference is readily drawn that possibly the experts were unable to corroborate the assertions of silver producers. While this part of the New Deal foreign trade policy failed dismally, if indeed it did not do gratuitous mischief, the rest of it, notably the re&#172; ciprocity trade agreements met with a considerable degree of success. The situation in American foreign trade need not be described except to say that exports and imports had fallen in 1932 roughly to one-half in volume, and two- thirds in money values, from their 1929 levels. Consequently in 1934, a Trade Agreements Act was passed, giving the President power to raise or lower tariffs by not more than 50$. Fourteen such agreements have now been negotiated, the most important being that with Canada. Time makes it impossible to summarize their provisions, except to say that agreements have been made with 8 of our 20 best customers, and now cover about 40$ of our imports and 35$ of our exports.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>In addition to the reciprocity trade agreements, there are certain general agreements that deserve passing mention, notably those with Czecko- slovakia and Ecuador, providing for reciprocal unconditional most-favored nation. treatment and the exchange of notes &quot;between Bullitt and Litvinoff, whereby Soviet Russia agreed to buy not less than $30,000,000 worth in the TJnited States. These agreements indicate that where possible,.the United States has not abandoned its traditional preference for most-favored nation policy. It dis&#172; likes special preferences and special bargains. One additional factor should be stressed. Even the shifts in foreign trade policy in the United States, and its shift to bargaining and quotas, were not made with a view primarily to the needs or problems of foreign countries. On the contrary, the primary emphasis, it seems to me, has been on the domestic welfare of domestic industries. The administration in its bargaining thinks primarily of stimulating exports for domestic industries, a viewpoint of course of long standingj except that now it is coupled with the realization that ex&#172; ports are bought with imports and consequently concessions must be offered. In the Canadian agreement, the reduction in duty on live cattle has been computed. as averaging $9.00 per head. The increased imports of live cattle have enabled Canadians to increase their purchases of manufactured goods, notably furniture. Domestic problem?,domestic advantage, have been the ruling considerations. In how far the increase in exports has been due to these trade policies I know no way of assessing.* Turning now to the MR A, I am, of course, in no way even able to touch the high spots. It can be discussed as a measure of recovery and of reform. In passing I might observe that the distinction so often made between relief, re&#172; covery and reform is not as valid as it is cometimes alleged to be. Dr. Davis and I, in looking at the wilderness of alphabeteria, decided merely to take up devaluation, AAA. silver, reciprocal trade agreements and. BRA as the most im&#172; portant recovery measures having international implications. Of these it should be noted that MA has in it the most generous admixture of reform. Yet I do not regard, nor has it been so regarded in administration circles, that recovery and reform are contradictory policies. In many cases recovery could not be achieved except through reform. This is probably the most significant aspect of the KRA experience. Eor it seems to me that BRA and other reform measures show something of a definite change in viewpoint on the part of the American government. Prior to 1933, there was a tendency to look upon the American economic system as reason&#172; ably perfect, and to attribute domestic ills to some &quot;foreign devil&#174;&quot; Ex&#172; planations of the depression, at least officially, usually looked upon it as something that slunk in upon us surreptitiously from abroad. The war in Europe. currency fluctuations, movements of long and short term capital, especially for&#172; eign withdrawals of gold were commonly emphasized. Since 1933, considerably greater.heed has been given those who were analyzing rather than eulogizing our own system with the result that there exists a greater consciousness of its defects. .Sometimes, indeed, responsible officials have suggested that there may have been something in our economy that caused the depression in other countriese We have recognized more that our own house was not in order, and been less disposed to lecture other countries. In fact, in some circles there ex&#172; ists active admiration of foreign countries, notably England and Sweden, and to some slight extent of Russia.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>This has not meant any real loss of allegiance to the American economic system. Despite the political froth of the moment, a temporal condition of the mouths of opposite camps of American politicians, largely assumed for purposes of preserving or securing the political patronage that follows success in elections, the American people, in my judgment, still adhere firmly, in their ideals at anj rate, to the principles of laissez faire. This laissez faire as I have said elsewhere does not mean merely &quot;absence of government interference - For that is nothing &quot;but anarchism. It means rather an all around renunciation of and &quot;binding guarantee against special interest legislation*... If we roughly translate laissez faire as {let alone1 it never meant that government should in all matters let &quot;business alone, or let the people as individuals or as groups and classes alone in their &quot;business dealings and relations with one anothern It meant rather that the government should compel all classes and individuals to let one another alone, or keep their hands off wealth &quot;belonging to others * In substance it is the American ideal of the athletic field, where,, to realize the noble ideals of fair play and equal opportunity, referees continuously exercise control over competitive activities in order that a maximum of liberty may be enjoyed by the contestants. So that each may secure the maximum individual reward commensurate with individual effort and individual ability, lanes or areas are narked out within which competitors must stay. In order to ensure better playing of the game. all the.rules, no matter how old, are regarded as being constantly on trial and changed when necessary by a rules committee which meets frequently for that purpose.&quot; The real shift in our recovery policy is that in our conception of what makes the business system go. Formerly we believed in the 11 trickling down&quot; theory. Recovery then meant recovery of profits and of returns to investors and enterprisers. Government action was used to pay interest to bond-holders and stimulate confidence among business men, all of this in the belief that such would promote the largest possible volume of industrial activity, the largest possible employment at highest possible wages. Now the action of government is based on a different observation, that of millions of farmers and laborers, who, while untrained in economic science none the less possess votes, and seem to be surprisingly unanimous in their belief that prosperity does not trickle down, but is diffused upv/ard. As they see it, feed income or purchasing power into laborers and farmers, and instead of going down it seems sometimes with distressing celerity and irresistible force to trickle up rather than down. Nov/ farmers and laborers, those with incomes lower than $3,000 consume 93Jo of the product of American factorieso So they say, prime the pump, give us confidence and security at the bottom, and we&apos;ll cease hoarding and begin buying. This is, of course, a very old theory, one first advanced by the Swiss economist Sismondi in 1819, in a book entitled &quot;Some New Principles of Political Economy0&quot; It is curious that he recommended four items: abolition of child labor, a shorter work week, a minimum wage, and in effect, social security legislation. The URA thus attempted to promote recovery not only directly by en&#172; abling industries organized under codes to put into effect monopolistic devices, control of production and marketing, which were thought would, and which did, increase prices and profits, but also by effecting labor reforms which have long</essay:p>

            <essay:p>&quot;been put into practice in certain industrialized countries of Europe* I should add that there has &quot;been recovery* Ihe laborers in NRA industries whose incomes had &quot;been most severely hit have experienced an increase of not less than 2ofc m real income. On the other hand, salaried workers and those with fixed incomes. who were &quot;benefiting undeservedly from lowering prices during the period f.t or: 1929 to 1933 are seeing a part of their unearned increment in real in-ionics taken away from them* parm income has likewise increased, as Dr. Davis po.&apos;ntod out.&#187; The cost of living has risen slightly., from an average oi 80*8 in .U-Vyi to 81.-1 in 1935c Wholesale prices rose rapidly some 25&apos;jo in 19-r53? hut have been remark&#172; ably stable for the last eighteen.months* Dividend and interest payments ere ^ running currently very near their 19^6 levels a Employment has-, h owevor, no-. i.&lt;- creased as much as had &quot;been hoped. True, some five and one* via .Lf mi/, liens have &quot;been put &quot;back to work since Mar ch of 1933, &quot;but the newcomers jn tne marke &#8226;, h-.- &gt;/o swollen the ranks of seekers so that there are probably still nine or oe.i millions out of worko National income produced has gone up from -3v&gt;f? lull ions in 1932 to 53 billions in 1935. But 1 do not believe that anyone can say.how much has been due to recovery measures and how much would have occurred no matter what brand of politicians had been successful in the elections of &apos;193-3. In conclusion, I want to pose three questions. Last nignt, Mr. Hoxland emphasised that the solution of our international difficulties may await tho completion of certain internal changes economically and socially in the various countries at interest. Conforming to his duties as host at the opening con&#172; ference he naturally made commendatory reference to the economic systems of our guestsc But this morning, may we Americans be permitted to cease being quite so tactful and inasmuch a.s you are studying America first, suggest that the American economic system of laissez faire be considered for its ins truetiveness. In fact, of course, our economic structure falls short of this ideal, bub we believe the goal of our striving is not only good for us cut good for otner countries in the Pacific. .Many of the innovations of the Hew Deal are not exclusively American any more than the situation out of which they arose is an exclusively -American situation. Many of the measures of the ITew Deal are functioning in other Pacific countries. You, toor have made some concessions to the &quot;trickling up&apos; or &quot;sucking up&quot; theory&#174; Let us compare notes.&apos; Which of these measures has vonceci out well in all countries? Which has worked badly? Which has been boih good and bad? Why? Economic scientists have such a distressingly small amount 02 real insight compared with the demands made upon them. Let us see if wo cannot increase the area of knowledgee Next I wish to ask, &quot;Is it so unwise for countries to concentrate on putting their own houses in order? May not that be the best way to promote recovery and.peace in other countries? For is it not depressed countries that experience that social unrest and turbulence that eventually leads tne.tr politicians to seek and find a &quot;foreign devil&quot; or a foreign policy upon wnich they give vent to their pent&#8212;up forces. May not a sound national economy be essential and preliminary to a sound international economy? And finally, may not the system of laissez faire contribute as much to world stability as any other?</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 22 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON U.S.A. ROUND TABLE TOPIC I, AUGUST 17, 1936 (A.F.W. Plumptre) As Dr. Dafoe said, I want to speak for a short time this evening about the general economic effects of what might be called the New Deal policies on Canada and on other countries in general, and to do that I want to divide the New Deal policies which I am going to consider into three separate categories. In the first category I want to group those price raising policies which included the NRA, the object of which was partly price raising, the monotary policy such as the Public Works policy, and the gold devaluation policy. All these policies had as part of their objects at least the raising of general prices. My second category is the AAA., which was partly also directed at raising agricultural prices but had as part of its program also a certain reduction of output&#174; And lastly, the third category I want to say a few words about the new trade agreement policy. I understand that the New Deal policies, particularly those in the first category which I mentioned, arc not so popular in the United States as they wore three years ago, and I understand also that the Supreme Court has dealt them a blow which, if not mortal, may at least be described as an unkind cut. In spite of all that I come not to bury but to praise the New Deal. I have heard in these discussions, perhaps more particularly from my elders and betters in the last two days, a good deal of criticism of the New Deal and its policies and its re&#172; sults, and I take at once for my defense and my text this evening, &quot;Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained praise.&quot; First of all I want to turn to the expansionist policies which increased or had as an object the increasing of prices and purchasing power. These policies all of them, I think - had singularly favorable repercussions upon Canada - more favorable than upon the United States, for in Canada we got most of the benefit with little of the ill effects which you had in the United States. In fact, I think one can claim that of all the countries in the world, not excluding, the United States, Canada, profited most from the New Deal. Take, for instance, the NRA. We profited first of all out of the short&#172; lived boom in 1933, that short speculative restocking boom - we profited as did large numbers of Canadian business men and also Canadian agricultural producers profited out of that short-lived more or less speculative boom. We profited in the longer run insofar as the NRA put more money in the hands of workers in the form of higher wages, and insdSbr as those workers spent that money, as many of them must have done, first directly upon Canadian goods coming in as tourists, as so many do in the summertime, or indirectly through American importers bring&#172; ing in goods from Canada. We gained in that way, but on the other hand in Canada the profitableness of this new spending was not offset, as it was in large measure in the United States, by the increase of costs due to increased wages; nor in Canada were the businessmen hampered and bothered first by the formulation of codes and then by the evasion of them. Turning from the NRA to the public spending programs again Canada benefit&#172; ed in large measure, I feel, as the result of indiroct spending at once through tourists again or upon imports from Canada, We gained from the favorable effects from that spending, but did not accumulate debts \vhich are acting in this country as a deterrent to businessmen. Take the gold revaluation policy, or if you like</essay:p>

            <essay:p>the depreciation of the .American dollar in terms of gold and to a rather less extent at the same time in terms of sterling, Canada profited very greatly out of that 1933 reshuffle of currencies* Previously we had been in a very &quot;bad position&#174; Since 1931^ when Great Britain abandoned the gold standard, the pound sterling had been at a substantial depreciation below -American funds, and the Canadian dollar had stood halfway between appreciation, in terns of sterling, and depreciation in terms of the Canadian dollar. That was an unfavorable situation, just insofar as a very important part of Canadian international transactions con&#172; sist, to put it very roughly in this &#171;. of selling goods like wheat to England and getting in return from that English pounds v/hich are swapped for American dollars, and those American dollars were used either to buy imports from the United States or to pay debts, of which wo have very many and very large ones in the United States - and we do pay them&#174; When the pound sterling depreciates in terms of the American dollar and we sell wheat in England, we get about the same amount of pounds in England but that buys fewer American dollars, and thattf therefore, pays fewer debts and buys fewer imports in the United States. Since&quot;1931 we have been in an unfavorable situation in the world currency situation&#174; With the Roosevelt devaluation in 1933, however, that particular situation in the world currencies was completely reversed, the Canadian dollar depredated below its old parity as against sterling, and rose to slight appreciation over parity with the American dollar for a very short time&#174; There again the American policy had favorable repercussions upon the world&#174; The gold policy had a further favorable effect, in that in 1928 or 1929 we were exporting gold valued at about 140,000,000. Today our annual exports of gold are well over $100,000,000 and here gold promises to be the second most val&#172; uable single commodity in our volume of exports. To mention one policy - the silver policy - our silver producers benefit&#172; ed as did American producers here in this country&#174; And I think that there can be little doubt that as there were favorable actions of the American policy on Canada, there were favorabie reactions of the American policy back on the United States itself&#174; For as our exports improved and as our business conditions improved, so we purchased more from the United States, and there has been a marked revival since 1933 of our purchases in this country&#174; Indeed, the rate of improvement since 1933 - a year after the Ottawa agreements &#171; the rate of improvement of our purchases in the United States has been a good deal greater than the rate of improvement of our purchases from Great Britain&#174; Now I want to turn one moment to the effects of the AAA, my second category&#174; This had as an objective the raising of agricultural prices and also to limit output. With tho rise in prices, a reduction in output occurred but there are those who believed this was not due to the AAA but grow out of benefits of the drought of 1934, 1935, and 1936. Be that as it may, there is no doubt that a certain amount of restriction has taken place - certain amount of diminished output has been achieved and a certain amount of price rise may be attributed to the administration, and this has given a much needed fillip in some of tho hard-pressed areas of the Canadian agricultural east and west&#174; So much for the rosy effects of the administration&apos;s policy upon Canada&#174; Now just a word or two about those effects upon countries other than Canada. No doubt it would be interesting and profitable to take the 52 countries of-&apos; world one by one and consider their position one after another. 1 remember that Puck, I believe, put a girdle around the earth in 40 minutes and brought back a sleeping</essay:p>

The movements of the duties appear to mo to be substantial, and they apply to what appear to me to bo a number of very important commodities. And I think it will encouragc trade without seriously damaging existing interests either in the United States or Canada, and that partly because it seems to have been engineered with some care but more particularly because it is being put into operation during a time of expanding markets, and expanding prosperity, when business, if it does take a knock, can stand it&#174; So, taking what I might call</essay:p>

            <essay:p>the short-run view, I think there is evidence that the trade agreement between Canada and the United States is likely to be fairly beneficial to both. Regarding the long-run, I have no re doubt, I would have no doubt if the agreement were permanent, but it is only to run for three years, and after that to be terminable after six months period - the same applies to most of the other agreements. Canadians have become used to mistrusting the Americans when they come bringing lower tariffs. Twice within living memory Canadians have built up a profitable export market in primary products to the Unitod Statos only to heve that market wiped out by a stroke of the presidential pen, and wo do not want to see it happen again if possible because it brings with it hardship and loss. I have said some kind things about the United States - and by the way^ I do not want it to be thought that I believe the administration had in view, when it enacted the NRA and these other policies, the favorable repercussion on Canada, Nevertheless, I have said kind things about the administration and the results of the American policy, and I would like to say one more thing. The trade agreements policy seems to mo to bo meeting with not inconsiderable success and it does therefore mark a reversal or some reversal of the trend of tariff walls over the past eight or ten years. That is all to the good. That it includes the most-favored-nation principle, instead of strict bilateralism, also seems to me to be a good omen; but the policy is good only in so far as it is constant. Like the Chinese delegate who spoke last, we too want stability. I havenTt talked this over with the Canadian delegates, but if there wore one request xvhich I think the Canadian delegates here would unanimously make to the United Statos, it would be perhaps this. In your trade agreements&apos; you have dealt with us kindly and fairly, justly, perhaps even generously. You have helped us promote prosperity - will you now, as far as is possible, endow that prosperity with some permanencee</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 21 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON U,S.A# ROUND TABLE TOPIC I, AUGUST 17, 1936 (Dr. Leonard Hsu) Before I talk I wish now to make an apology. I shall speak on the effect of the American silver purchase policy on China rather than stop at silver policy, for two reasons: I was more prepared on that subject when I was asked to dpocik this afternoon of the effects on China. The second justification of my apology is the effect on China is a good example of the international implication of the .American silver policy. Its policy of one country affects the welfare of another country, and I can speak more concretely and specifically. My time is ten minutes. The acknowledgment of the silverites in .America that the American silver purchasing policy, through raising the value of silver, tends to increase the purchasing power of China and thereby prove beneficial to American trade with China, has caused much concern and debate in China. As a result, the Chinese national government appoints, in the Ministry of Industry, a committee to make a special study of the subject, and this committee spent one year and a half to make the study and issue their report, entitled &quot;Silver and Priccs in China,&quot; published in China both in English and Chinese. The result of the stucfcr to speak in simple language, was somewhat like this: The United States silver policy tends to increase the price of silver; the higher price of silver tends to in&#172; crease the value of the Chinese dollar, because the Chinese dollar was based upon silver; and the higher value of the Chinese dollar means lower commodity prices in China* Again the lower commodity prices in China meant less income for the general population, and that, thereby, causes general economic depression. This depression resulted in lessening purchasing power, and this decrease of the purchasing power of the Chinese population has caused less imports from foreign countries to China, because the Chinese could buy less. Therefore, the silver policy of the United States was harmful to both China and the United States from the standpoint of Chinese trade with the United States. Our discussions was that it was the state of business conditions in China rather than the exchange rates that most affected the imports of China. There&#172; fore, the rise in silver purchasing power caused Chinese imports to decline. If you are interested in figures, I should be glad to refer you to the reports the Chinese delegation will be glad to supply. In my opinion, it is exaggerated to ascribe the economic depression in China, as if it was entirely dependent on the silver situation due to the operation of the American silver purchasing policy. Perhaps it is nearer to the truth to say that the -American silver purchasing policy accentuated the Chinese economic depression and hastened to bring the crisis to a head. I am glad that it did because it meant to us this currency reform. It was a blessing in disguise.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Speaking of the economic depression in Chinat from 1932 to 1935 China experienced a depression; the degree of severity was perhaps not much less than that of the United States, although as a rule the Chinese were more patient than the Americans, so that we made less fuss about it&#174; In analyzing the causes of the Chinese depression, we want to find out what arc the factors - monetary and other factors - influencing the commodity, prices in China, which in turn caused the depression&#174; The result of our studies was that largely the cause was the price of silver and the value of the Chinese dollar&#174; The value of the Chinese dollar caused wholesale prices in Shanghai to decline 13g$ in 1932 and 7&#174;1% in 1933&#174; What were&quot;the social and economic effects? First was a decline in government revenue. The customs receipts, receipts from land taxes were de&#172; creased, revenue from local governments and provincial governments decreased. In spite of the decline in revenue, then we had an increase in the government budget because the percentage of money needed to meet debt service was increased&#174; Because of the widespread of social and economic unrest we needed more expenses for policing. Our expenses for debt services and military service and other services tenAed to increase. Then foreign trade: we faced a decrease in exports and imports. As a result wo had an enormous amount of adverse balance of trade. In addition, the city business declined. Our studies of these economic conditions in Shanghai, Peiping, Tsintao, Nanking and othor cities in China clearly showed that as soon as the silver dollar went up business went broke&#174; So the bankers got embarrassed, because business, industry, and commerce were not profitable occupations so the bankers suddenly found their money had no place to go., so there was an enormous amount of money in Shanghai. Shanghai faced artificial prosperity where the rest of the country faced a severe depression. Above all, agricultural prices dropped, dropped from 25 5o 75%, and that means less income for the farmers - hard living for them - that means for 80 to 85% of the 450 million. We have 450 million now&#174; In what way did the American silver purchasing policy affoct China? In two ways. One was it further raises the exchange value of the Chinese dollar because of the rise of the silver price. For example, the price of silver in New York rose from 65/ an ounce in 1933 to over 75/ an ounce in December, 1935.. Second, because of the artificial appreciation of the value of silver in foreign markets, a disparity developed between London exchange prices of silver and the Chinese exchange rate. This disparity was as high as 14-g% at the end of 1935&#174; This in turn causes the exodus of silver. The smuggling of silver from China was estimated at $570^000,000 worth of silver in 1934 and 1935. In the meantime I may say that the United States acquired approximately one billion ounces of silver and half came from China, so you had a good policy at our expense. This drastic change on the monetary stock of China causes immediate embarrassment upon the bankers, in Shanghai, but worse than that, it caused a lot of misery to the Chinese farmers. Wo did what we could - measures were taken to prevent this misery&#174; First we established the so&#8212;called equalization charges to equalize the disparity between London silver prices and Chinese exchange rate. Second, we imposed an export duty on silver in order to lessen these exports of silver. Third, wo imposed severe anti-smuggling laws; fourth, the provincial governments and the city governments in various places also enacted severe punishments against speculators and silver exporters. But after many months of trial very little good was done. So in</essay:p>

            <essay:p>November, 1935, China determined to help herself* China was forced to abandon the silver standard altogether. Now we have a so-called managed currency. This managed currency has enabled us to be comparatively free from the effect of changes in the price of silver abroad. I may say, also, this adoption of currency reform is of China&apos;s own volition&#174; It is not so much due to the insti&#172; gation of any of our foreign advisers, as is usually believed. What have been the effects? First, the period of utmost exchange in&#172; stability has somewhat ended and this period is now more or less replaced by management of currency designed to maintain stability# Second, no multiplicity of note issues and scattering of currency reserves take place. We are trying to centralize control of the note issue and the custody of reserves in the hands of what we call the Currency Reserve Board# Third, the unit of account is unified on the basis of the so-called &quot;Legal standard dollar&quot; throughout the country. This means geographical unification of the standard unit. Fourth, wo have a greater centralization of control by government banks over commercial banks, and that means more stability of the commercial banks. Fifth, this stability of exchange has restored more or less public confidence and causes more money to circulate so that you see the revival of trade and the recovery of prices. Again, the farmers are benefited. This year the farmers are more prosperous than ever before in China&#174; In fact, the Chinese are in better condition than in the last ten years almost&#174; Since the currency reform, what is the effect of the .American policy in China at present? I may say the effect is more indirect &#171; nevertheless very important, for two reasons. One is that although the Chinese dollar cannot ex&#172; change for silver it can exchange for the United States dollar or other foreign currencies. Second, the reserve against our ncte issue is still silver, so dras&#172; tic changes in the prices of silver in foreign countries arc still matters of direct concern to us5 for the future of Chinese currency we hope the price of silver shall be stabilized and is not fluctuated violently in one way or the other&#174; Stability is our watchword and we hope it will be your watchword. This stability affects the peace of the Far East. For example, the higher price of silver, as I said in the past,, may cause the prices to drop. This economic depression means wider spread of social and economic unrest in China&#174; Now, as Mr&#174; Belshaw has summarized, the reconstruction policy in China today rests upon the amount of financial support. This financial support comes at the present time largely from internal taxes - land taxes, customs, general tax, maybe in the next few years there will be an income tax. This income from taxes - the govern&#172; ment revenue from taxos - again depends on general stability - economic and social stability - of the country. Now we have entered another agreement with the United States - the agreement has been entered into between the United States and China whereby the United States treasury would purchase an unstated amount of silver from China and China agrees to leave the proceeds of the sales in the United States for the purpose of stabilizing exchanges and maintain a reserve in silver against our note issue so long as the United States adheres to its present policy of purchasing cilver&#187; Suppose the United States changes its mind again. Suppose you say silver is no longer my sweetheart, This means a lower value of silver&#174; This will affect the Chinese rosorvo0 If it isn*t your sweetheart, it is still our sweetheart. It will affect our currency and cause the same confusion, and go back to the same economic depression&#169; What wo need is stability. We don&apos;t care about other kinds of stability, but we do care about stability of commodity prices in China - stability of your policy. Stability moans economic development in China, As the previous speaker said, a strong united prosperous China is the best security of the Far East, Therefore, in your peace is our peace, in our peace is your peace, for your stability is our stability.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 27 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON U.S.A. ROUND TABLE TOPIC I, AUGUST 17, 1936 (Chester Rowell) As in duty bound the Americans, as the host nation, have placed them&#172; selves first upon the operating table subject to the scalpel. The others will have their turn later. And now you have asked me as the representative of the host nation to face the most difficult and the most delicate of all of our questions. The most difficult because it seems to be agreed that this policy, which I cm about to elucidate, does not exist and the most delicate because it has been requested that I shall discuss it with reference to the naval policy of the United States. In other words, I shall discuss political foreign relations with reference to what is avowedly a machine of war&#174; There could bo no more delicate subject. I E&apos;hall hope to treat it delicately. As to this policy, however, if it cannot be reasoned it can perhaps bo rationalized. We can at least relate this naval policy to another policy which has some coherence, end we can give an explanation of the naval policy with reference to the diplomatic policy, which would be rational if the relation were actual, The United States as has been pointed out in the round tables and as is a familiar fact, has had three policies toward the three regions of the earth and those three policies we have not attempted to bring under one formula. The policy toward Europe has boon one of political isolation and of economic interrelation, and we have determined to maintain both and maintain them both in spite of the fact that that inconsistency has gotten us into both of the groat ISuropecin wars through the back door. Toward the two Americas, our policy is the Monroe Doctrine, a difficult subject which I will not at this moment undertake to discuss, except to say that to the extent that the present troubled condition of the xvorld revives not only part of the original importance of the Monroe Doctrine which is the protection of the integrity of all the nations of this continent, and that to that extent our naval policy may be hold to have a consistent and tangible defense purpose. Our policy across the ocean centers largely upon what we have called the policy of the Open Door in China. And that being the only one within the juris&#172; diction of this Conference, lot us see what, if any, relationship our foreign policy toward the Pacific nations has toward our naval policy and how it may bo adjusted to this policy,, This policy of the Open Door is far older than its formulation by John Hay in the administration of McKinley. Ho formulated it, however, as a name at a time when it was threatened by Europe, and wo used the voice of diplomacy and the potential menace of navies - not our navy, except in part but of the various European navies against each other to produco an agreement by them that they would not break through the principle of the Open Door in China. So there was a definite policy by the United States in using diplomacy for protection of that doctrine when it was threatened by Europe.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>A second caso was in the Washington Conference of 1922 when as a politi&#172; cal condition of the naval disarmament which reduced the navies on the two sid os of the ocean so that it would &quot;be physically impossible for them to conduct an ag&#172; gressive war in either direction, a political consideration of that was the Nine- Power Treaty which secured not only the Open Door but which included the oilargod expression of respect for the integrity of China not merely territorial but administrative. As things have since developed, it has boon the opinion of this country that this political consideration and the naval agreement were inseparable, and it has been the argument from the Japanese side that they were separable, ivnd now when again this question of the Open Door in China comes up again, there is the question whether the diplomatic voice of the United States is or is not again being raised upon that question, and the present fact is that the diplomatic voice of the United States is raised very little upon that or any other question by virtue of the fact that we have in this timo of distress concentrated ourselves very largely upon our own problosns. Now relate that history to the history of those naval treaties and if possible to the rationalization of our Pacific naval policy. The naval treaties as you know in their present stage began first with the Washington Conference, in which we dealt with the throe first rank navies and the two second-rank navies. The arithmetic of naval policy is far simpler than the arithmetic of land policy^ because there are only three first-rank navies in the world - there wore only two more of the second-rank - wo may have to reckon in the future with two more that may develop. At that Washington Conference we reached agreement upon capital ships, including the throe major navies upon that basis of parity of the 5-5-3 ratio which British end Americans insist is parity and an effective ratio, and which the Japanese reluctantly accepted but which they protested and have since continued to protest does not constitute parity. We were not able to extend that to cruisers and auxiliary vessels. The second London Naval Conference was held with the purpose of doing that, but because it was a five&#8212;power treaty and a five&#8212;power agreement could not be done, the agreements had to be very provisional with escape clauses, and that confercnce, while it accepted some things, accepted far loss than the hopes of those who promoted it. The Third Conference in London had for its purpose, if possible, to extend beyond its original terms these Washington Conference treaties after the date of their expiration&#174; But that foundered upon the definition of parity. The American definition of parity was what we called effective parity, and we insisted that 5-5-3 ratio constituted that. The Japanese definition was equality. Hence, both sides were fixed in that policy, the Japanese withdrew from it, we are now committed in principal to an unlimited naval race as soon as the treaty expires. There is no one of us who wishes to engage in that naval race. That is the familiar history of these treaties. Now, if possible, rationalize the American naval policy to this fairly clear, foreign policy, and I don&apos;t claim that this rationalized relation is in fact as clear as one could formulate it. In the first place, in answer to this troubled inquiry as to why America is just now engaged in a groat naval building program at the very time when professing to be withdrawing from imperialistic ambitions, the answer is wholly irrational and very practical and clear. One of the major reasons for building these ships is that we want to spend the money, and this is the quickoi and easiest way to do it. We have a great program of making work, the larger en&#172; terprises usually require a long time to plan and prepare. The ships are already planned and a very large part of the motives that have produced so much enthusiasm in Congress is that this is the quickest and easiest form of public work. If we &quot;Should later do with them what we did with them at the Washington Conference - sink them - that is the cheapest thing you can do with a naval vessel. It would, how&#172; ever. be entirely false to assume that that is the whole of the case.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The rest of the case, however, is a part of the general confusion of our varying thoughts ae to what the navy is for, after all. The ,navy is for defense, but what is it going to defend? Our naval experts themselves* are wholly incapable of knowing what sort of navy we need, because our political authorities wholly refrain from saying to them what they shall be called upon t&lt;3 do with that navy. If the purpose of the navy were defense of our shores, in the first place it would have to be very different sort of navy and in the second place the shores arenft going to have to be defended, as against the sort of war that might start any day between France and Germany and could not start in that way between America and any other country. Any future war will be through the back door the same way as before, and the ordinary theory of the war gome which rests upon the hypothesis that war has been declared, omits all realities - wars aren&apos;t declared in that way. Nevertheless, much of the theory is based upon the fact that somebody might come and attack us and we might need to be defended,, My opinion against that sort of hypo&#172; thesis is that we are dealing with facts. But there are other purposes of navies. As I said in one of the round tables to day $ the navy is the amplifier of the voice of the diplomat. The voice of the diplomat speaks exactly as loud as the potential voice of his cannon, and if those cannons are potentially loud enough they never have to be used because he -will be heard. Now, if the time should come in the future that onco more the voice of American diplomacy would be raised upon the question of the Open Door in China,including the definitions of that in the Nino-Power Treaty, we should not wish the voice of our diplomats to be muzzled and unheard by the refusal of anybody to listen, and we have recently learned by observation and experience in Europe that that can happen - that he who does not wish to listen to the diplomat who raises a question can successfully do so more or less. If this question should arise - it is doubtful - and if it is doubtful it is doubtful if we need a navy policy in the Pacific &#8226;&#187; if it should arise it is desirable that the voice of the diplomats both ways should be heard and heeded, and if they need the amplifier, then this should bo loud enough to make them heard, and then the voice of reason can prevail. As to the other jingo danger which appears in the jingo press of both countries, it is wholly irrational. I would eliminate that from our naval policy. It would be physically possible for head on war to take place on the Atlantic be&#172; tween the American and British navies because the diameter of the Atlantic is with&#172; in radius of fleet action. The policy of both countries is based upon the assump&#172; tion that that will never happen. Under these naval limitations, we have on the Pacific the additional protection that the diameter of the Pacific is far beyond the radius of fleet action, and so that sort of war upon the Pacific^ even if otherwise possible, as an additional protection is physically impossible. If under our peculiar conditions it is impossible to find either con&#172; tinuity or complete explanation for our naval policy, at least we may hypothetically rationalize that naval policy as related or relatable to the much more tangible diplomatic policy which is part of the permanent history of the United States.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 28 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON U.S.A. ROUND TABLE TOPIC I, AUGUST 17, 1936 (A. G# Elliot-Smith) I think you will all agree that Mr. Rowell is a difficult man to follow, and after his intense factual survey I feel my abstract speculation may fall a little flat, I think it is impossible for us of the British group not to be interested in the recovery program of a nation which after all we may somewhat claim is our own flesh and blood. But I think it is only true to say that what we are par&#172; ticularly interested in is how far the return of governmental and public opinion in the United States lies toward a policy of isolation or whether she is more prepared to cooperate in world economic recovery and in the maintenance of world peace. I said that was the British view but I don&apos;t think it is a selfish.-oAo;s* because we are coming to realize more and more that not only is peace indivisible but so also&apos;&apos;is economic prosperity. A single nation may have a temporary advantage at the expense of another nation, but such an advantage is neither durable nor desirable, and the converse is equally true. No-./,. I don&apos;t think it would be wholly inopportune here to deal with, I think, a rather widely spread misapprehension as to the interpretation that should be put upon Sir Samuel Hoaro&apos;s speech of September 11 last year in relation to an examination of markets and access to raw materials. There are many, I think, who seem to believe &quot;chat Great Britain is conscious of her weakness and is now preparing to hand over her colonies piece-meal; while the enemies of Great Britain see in this speech just another attempt by perfidious Albion to hand over somebody else&apos;s colonies or territory. I would ask you to believe that neither of these two interpretations is the true one, but that the explanation lies in&quot;what I have already said&#8212;we are coming more and more to be&#172; lieve that peace and prosperity are both indefensible. All nations must in some degree be dissatisfied. This is the purpose of the conference; we want to find out what are the legitimate demands of the various peoples and to see how those demands can be satisfied. If they can&#8212;not merely by changing over the roles of what have come rather unfortunately to be callcd the satisfied and dissatisfied nations. And I think it will be clear from this the isolationist policy on the part of any country will militate against such a hope&#8212; firstly, in that it must paralyze trade, and secondly, it means that a nation is going to v\rithhold its help from those who do not wish to see that the use of legitimate demands does not degenerate into the satisfaction of the stronger at the expense of the weaker, or, to put it another way, to withhold its help from those who would like to see the lion lie down with the lamb, but that the lamb shall not bo inside the lion. Frankly, for us, I think, the outcome of the round table discussions is slightly discouraging, Vie welcome recovery while realizing that it is difficult to determine how much of that recovery is due to governmental action, how much to climatic caprice, how much to the general up-swing of the pendulum of world prosperity. In so far as limitation of crops, for instance, has helped the dom&#172; inions, I think we should be hypocrites if we pretended we were sorry. The some also applies to trade agreements which have been made, and also to the somewhat vicarious method by which America has brought about the stabilizing of the currency of China. But if those trade agreements&#8212;these limitations&#8212;must be interpreted as an indication that an isolationist policy is to become permanent rather than a transitory phase for a period of internal house-tidying, then America is going to delay longer in playing her part in a world In which economics</essay:p>

            <essay:p>have become international. Turning to the purely political aspects, it would seem that it is rather like the weather forecast for three-quarters of the British summer-further outlook unsettled. I think you all would be irritated at that particular state, because you don&apos;t know whether to take your coat because it will be too hot&#8212;on the other hand if you don&apos;t take your coat your clothes may be ruined. I think that possibly that is not an inept analogy with the world situation&#8212;where we have every nation re-arming at its fullest ra e because of uncertainly as to what is to happen and uncertainty as to who is friend and who is its foe. There is one thing -which might be described as a bright period in the round- table discussion&#8212;that was the evidence that United States, Great Britain, and Japan would be glad to see the integrity of the Philippines guaranteed. But that left many questions unanswered. Is that to be simply a pledge of non-aggrcssionj will that bring certainty; will it involve military commitmentj is it to be yoked to the full with the collective security of the world? Mr. Chester Howell has outlined the American naval policy, but if there is one thing that has emerged from the discussion of the round tables, I still feel it is that the American foreign policy is somewhat confused, and the point I desire to make more than any other is that it is the uncertainty as to what a great nation like America is going to do that is perhaps one of the greatest factors for insecurity in the world at the moment. We had in one round table at which I was present this morning the suggestion that America would probably act and cooperate with collective security in actual fact or at least she would not interfere with such measuies as migh e sen o further collective security; but except that the mercurial temperament, to use an American&apos;s words, the mercurial torporament of the iimerican mind&#8212;which seemed unlikely she would make that declaration beforehand, and so the children of un&#172; certainty must remain. I do not want this to be interpreted as an appeal for an Ando-American alliance of the pre-war type. What I wish to see^is America taking a distinct place in the comity of notions, bocause, as I have said above, and don&apos;t hesitate to repeat it, we feel that there is no such thing as national prosperity or national security unless it be embraced in world prosperity and world poacc.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Ebcument 6 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON U.S.A. ROUND TABLES, AUGUST 17,1936, 8:00 p.m. (H. BELSHAW) The Round Table discussions were centered in the main on the inter&#172; national implications of recent policy in the United States, more especially since the advent of the Roosevelt Administration. Discussion first centered on the extent to which the Recovery Program had taken international implications into account. The Recovery Program was directed primarily to the solution of internal difficulties &quot;but it would not be true to say that international impli&#172; cations were entirely ignored, or that the bearing of international trade policies on domestic rocovery was entirely neglected. The attempts to negotiate trade agreements afford positive evidence that the importance of reducing barriers to international trade was recognized. The view that agreements to stabilize currencies at the time of the London Conference was premature in the interests of the world as a whole and that the United States could best serve such interests by placing its own currency on a satisfactory basis provided at least an ostensible motive for the refusal to enter into stabilization agreements. Nevertheless the preoccupation of the Administration with domestic re&#172; covery was abundantly clear. Whore domestic and international interests con&#172; flicted, the latter tended to be sacrificed. Thus the Restriction Program of the AAA was pursued despite the necessity which it imposed for countervailing duties on imports and despite the risk that competitors might capture some portion of world markets for foodstuffs and raw materials. There was indeed some conflict of opinion both among the general public and in the ranks of the President&apos;s advisers. Some looked to a recovery in world trade as a necessary condition of recovery in the United States, Others maintained that a national recovery program could be made to succeed irrespective of external conditions. Still others argued that the interests of world recovery would be more effectively served by a domestic policy promoting prosperity in the United States even though this temporarily hampered the international flow of commodities, than by a policy which concentrated on international aspects of the problem. Just as opinion was by no means homogeneous, so the policy was not entirely consistent - the objective of economic insulation could not always be completely reconciled with bilateral trade agreements which might result in lower tariffs. An American member expressed the view that the majority opinion in the United States was in favour of both economic and political isolation. Since politicians are not entirely uninfluenced by the opinions of voters it therefore becomes a vital issue whether or not this trend in opinion will continue. Other members suggested that the trend towards isolation was largely a depression</essay:p>

            <essay:p>phenomenon which would change with recovery. The expansion of American in&#172; dustrial production would then impose an urge towards the development of new markets in order to dispose of surpluses and this would weaken the sentiment towards economic isolation. Since economic expansion would thus cross the1 interests of other nations, it was not compatible with political isolation. In short, economic oxpansion being given, the &quot;United States v/ould no longer be an entirely free agent, for those nations whose interests appeared to be prejudiced might take action in respect of which political isolation would be considered inappropriate* Attempts to expand trade had been made through the device of bilateral agreements of -which 14 had already been negotiated. In the absence of action on a more comprehensive scale, bilateral agreements might make towards a lower&#172; ing of tariff barriers, thus promoting trade expansion. Since the agreement with Canada there had been an expansion of trade between the two countries. Although this had resulted in the main from the general trend towards recovery, the trade agreement was no doubt a factor. Little evidence was forthcoming as to the effects on other countries. Despite certain possible advantages, bi&#172; lateral agreements were fraught with certain obvious risks. The competitive interests of non-participating nations might be prejudiced and retaliatory action encouraged. Frequently negotiations were conducive to irritation and misunderstanding. In large measure bilateral agreements were a response to de&#172; pression; to shifting pressures on the balance of payments and to exchange in&#172; stability&#174; As a defense measure they might be justified, but when once curren&#172; cies were stabilized they tended to perpetrate uncertainty; they led to new disturbances and made the problem of stabilization more difficult. In the British Empire they cut across the principle of imperial preference and so were difficult to negotiate. The effects of the AAA appeared to differ in different countries of the Pacific Area and were confused by adverse weather conditions in the United States, especially in 1934 and 1936. Canada benefited without having to share the costs. So also did other countries which competed in world markets in such commodities as wheat, but tariffs on butter and other livestock products wore disadvantageous to surplus producing countries such as Australia and Now Zealand. Although the emphasis in the new programme was on soil conservation, restriction seemed to bo at least a secondary motive which lessoned the chances of tariff reductions. In so far as the Soil Conservation Program tended to restrict the production of wheat and other grains, it v/ould continue to benefit competitors on world markets. A likely effect was the relative increase in the production of the livestock products and this gave small hope of a reduction in tariffs on such products. The silver policy of the United States found no support in the Round Table discussions even amongst American members. It was regarded partly as a racket and partly as a policy, but it failed both as a racket and as a policy. Silver interests had argued that a high price for silver would increase the purchasing power of China in other countries oven though economists had pro&#172; phesied precisely the opposite effects. The silver policy was strongly condemned by all Chinese members at the Round Tables since it had depressed prices in China. The effects were particularly serious to agricultural producers because prices declined while tax rates and other costs remained fixed. So it occasioned</essay:p>

            <essay:p>widespread distress which was soon transmitted to the cities. It reduced Chinese exports because of effects on exchange and affectcd China&apos;s capacity to purchase from abroad. The depressing effects on taxable capacity seriously interfered with the reconstruction program in China, While changes in prosper&#172; ity in China were due to more general causes, the American silver policy had aggravated the depression, British and Japanese members considered that the silver policy had seriously affected the economic interests of their respective countries. It reduced trade, impaired the capacity of China to make payments on foreign debts and weakened the position of the banks, Chinese opinion was emphatic that the recent reform of the currency had proved wholly beneficial but might easily be endangered by American silver policy in the future, so China did not desire any change in the price of silver but was anxious that it should be kept stable. Some differences of opinion emerged on the economic effects of exchange depreciation. The evidence of trade statistics suggested that American trade had improved in most Pacific countries, but an economist member argued that such benefits wore temporary and were obtained at the expense of competitors. To this point of view the reply was made that exchange depreciation might still be a necessary method of adjustment even if it were granted that the direct effects were temporary. It might prove the simplest and most effective means of lessening the burden of fixed costs in export industries. Further, its influence in promoting recovery in the countries which practiced it might more than offset its injurious effects elsewhere. If American devaluation had assisted recovery in the United States it had probably assisted world recovery. Members from various national groups expressed considerable difficulty in understanding the foreign policy of the United States in the Pacific Area; or in reconciling the denials of imperialist aims and the desire to withdraw from situations which might involve America, with tho recent intensification of naval construction. These difficulties proved to bo shared by American members so that there was no coherent analysis of American policy in relation to naval construction. As one Chinese member put it, the United States seemed not to have a policy but only ideas about policy. An American member suggested that the difficulty in interpretation might bo due to the apparent lack of continuity in policy# con&#172; ditioned mainly by tho sensitiveness of tho Government to public opinion&apos; - a public opinion susceptible to change under the influence of demagogues, It was further suggested that naval construction might be proceeding under the cover of official expressions of policy which were very different from tho considerations which were actually determinant. So policy might be separated from the general attitude of the people. It was argued that while America desired to avoid European entanglements and consistently played the part of the good neighbour in South America, there was no intention of withdrawing from the Pacific, A strong body of opinion described American policy as motivated by considerations of defense. The United States would not risk the life of a single soldier to retain its interests in China, Nevertheless American commitments in the Philippines might entangle the United States in a defensive war, A Japanese member expressed the view that the naval program of the United States had intensified competitive construction in Japan, Japan was</essay:p>

Such a guarantee was conditional upon the maintenance of the Open Door and agreement not to use the Philippines for military or naval purposes. A Chinese member forcefully presented the view that China was the focal area in the problem of maintaining peace in the Pacific. The present policy of China was to help herself, but sho was seriously hampered by political and economic pressure. A strong arid united china was the best guarantee of peace in the Pacific and Pacific countries would achieve more by cooperation in building a strong, prosperous and united China than by building armaments. So the discussion ended, by strong emphasis on the close relationship between economic and political conditions, and with a plea to remove a cause of conflict rather than engage in costly preparation against it.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 33 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON JAPAN ROUND TABLE TOPIC II, AUGUST 18, 1936 (Kenzo Oshima) As the attention of the whole world appears to be increasingly centered upon the recent growth of Japan&apos;s export trade, I consider it proper at this time to present certain pertinent facts, end to outline briefly the factors underlying the situation* To begin with, I should like to present figures indicating the real position of Japan&apos;s export trade during the years 1931-1935. Total exports dur&#172; ing 1931 were valued at 1,146,000,000 yen; they increased in 1933 to 1,861,000,000 yen; and in 1935 they further increased to 2,499,000,000, the highest export figure ever attained by Japan. During these years, then, there was an increase of more than one hundred percent and the status of the pre-deprcssion period, namely that of 192 7, was restored to her. As would be expected, imports increased during the same period, but the rate of their increase did not correspond to that of exports. The consequence was that Japan&apos;s trade balance achieved a remarkable improvement. Specifically, the end of the year 1931 saw an adverse balance of 88,000,000 yen- but in 1935 the balance was 26,000,000 in favor of Japan. The figures cited indicate the growth in value of the export trade and a similar phenomenon can be noted in the volume; the figure for 1931 was 5,295,000 tons, whereas that for 1935 grew to 9,045,000 tons. Next, I should like to review briefly the items of Japan&apos;s export trade. Articles wholly manufactured, which in 1931 constituted 46.5% of the total volume of exports, increased in percentage to 58.1 per cent for 1935. In this connection, we cannot ignore the change in the proportion that raw materials occupied in relation to Japan&apos;s total volume of imports; ..it was, in 1931, 55.4%, whereas in 1935 it had grown to 61%. Thirdly, 1 should like to point out the geographical changes in distri&#172; bution of Japan&apos;s exports. In 1931, exports to Asia were 44% of the total volume and in 1935 they increased to 52%, whereas combined exports to Central and South America, Africa and Oceania, almost negligible i&amp; 1931, wore, in 1935, 15.6% of the total volume. On the other hand, exports to Europe and North America showed a tendency to be stati onary# Lastly, the principal export goods, hitherto limited to cotton goods and silk, came to include miscellaneous commodities which showing a remarkable increase, constituted in 1935 more than 50% of the total volume of Japan&apos;s exports. These facts are sufficient to show, in its broadest outline, the position occupied by Japan&apos;s export trade in recent years. Next, I should like to turn briefly to the principal causes for this rather remarkable development.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>First, the rationalization of industries must bo considered as one of its important co.uses. As&apos;is generally known, Japan has been suffering since 1920 and especially since 1927, from severe economic depression. During this period her industrial corporations, by enduring many hardships, contrivod to rationalize and re-organize methods of production and marketing* Throughout the depression period Japanese corporations, either by abandoning dividends, writing off capital investment, or by enduring various other sacrifices, achieved successful re&#172; adjustment in the various spheres of industry# And so, vjhen a change of Ministry in 1931 brought about a policy of inflation to replace the policy of deflation to &apos; which the outgoing Ministry had adhered, Japan1s industries found themselves fully prepared for the new condition* This fact is partly responsible for the tempo with which Japanese goods rushed out to foreign markots# Second, Technological developtoGnt - invention and improvement of mech&#172; anical equipment - gradually enabled Japan&apos;s industries to supply themselves with their own machinery&#174; A good example of this is clearly discernablo in the vreaving industry* As the third cause, exchange depreciation should be mentioned. The de&#172; preciation of the yen resulted from the fact that the yen had theretofore been over-valued, and was now adjusted by a natural, economic process to its justifi&#172; able value# This situation&apos;was nob, as is sometmes alleged^ brought about either artifically or deliberately* The fourth cause is that industrial organizations have been strictly ad&#172; hering to &quot;sound finance principles&quot; - exemplified in the cotton spinning and rayon industries. The following figures will clarify the fifth cause, which is labor efficiency; in 1920 there were required 106 males or 344 females to operate 10,000 spindles in the textile industry, and the annual per capita production was 12.7 bales. In 1935, the sane number of spindles required only 25 males or 160 females, and the per capita annual production was 23.7 bales, almost double the preceding -amount. I cannot conclude this brief exposition without pointing out the fact that the&apos; development of Japan&apos;s export trade has been over-emphasized in popular thinking, and has often been wrongly interpreted. According to recent studios made by League of Nations researchers, Japan&apos;s exports amount to but 4.44% of the total volume of world exports. This figure is practically the same as those for Canada, Holland, and Belgium. Mow, bearing in mind the fact that Japan&apos;s population is ten times as large as that of any&#176;of the above mentioned countries, the development of Japan&apos;s industries must be recognized as a necessary moans of preserving her livelihood. Hence, it should be obvious that Japan&apos;s export trade cannot be considered as unduly expanded; rather it is to be recognized as a natural and inevitable consequence of the growth of her economic capacity. Using the index number of value of export trade for 1928 as a basic 100, the numbers for 1931 and 1935 are respectively 58 and 127* With regard to the volume of production, taking again the index number of 1928 as a basic 100, the numbers for 1931 and 1935 are respectively 107.8 and 192.3. These figures, however, should not be viewed superficially or as an independent phenomenon.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The Japanese nation, though one of the oldest in the world, has but a short history of about a half centuiy since it made its debut on the stage of world economy* Consequently, Japan has had to make tremendous efforts in order to keep pace with other advanced countries of Europe and America, These efforts, moreover, have always been made with two objects in view; one is to feed and clothe her rapidly growing population; and the other is to contribute toward the promotion of human welfare in cooperation with other leading powers of the world* In addition, there is another fact which should not be overlooked in connection with the growth of Japan&apos;s export trade. Japan has always been a debtor country since the beginning of her economic contact with foreign countries. And she has never failed to carry out her obligations in this respect. It is of interest to note in the following figures the proportions which the amounts re&#172; quired for payment of foreign debts plus tJap value of imported foodstuffs and raw materials bear to the value of Japan&apos;s exports. A The amount required for the payment of foreign debts. &quot;&quot;[Million dollars )* B The value of imported food&#172; stuffs Total of A &amp; B Value of Exports 323 382 280 4 3 1931 470 400 330 70 1932 620 541 451 90 1933 724 618 &#9632;50 90 1934 * At present exchange rate Objectively considered, those figures show that with foreign debt obliga&#172; tions to be met - an obligation which Japan has never shirked - and with tremendous expenditures necessary to import food and raw materials for her growing population, Japan&apos;s apparent rapid growth in exports is the inevitable result of her deter&#172; mination to meet her obligations to her own people and to maintain her integrity and position among the Powers, And in these figures will be perceived not only Japan&apos;s efforts to serve her internal problem but also her spirit of cooperation and her faithfulness towards her external obligations. I think I have already presented all the points which are necessary for the comprehension of the recent development of Japan&apos;s export trade. I should like, hoiA/evor, to add a few words in conclusion; that is, whenever Japan&apos;s growth of export trade might be considered as colliding with the interests of another nation, Japan vrould always be prepared and willing to collaborate with that nation, in a most friendly manner, for the sake of attaining a solution which is most advantageous for both of the parties concerned.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 34 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON JAPAN ROUND TABLE TOPIC II, AUGUST 18, 1936 (The Rt, Hon# A,V, Alexander,M,P,) In dealing with this obviously difficult subject, a proper spirit, a true conciliation, and a consideration for the needs of great populations in the world by other nations in the world, are essential. First I would like to refer to the agenda revisions. It has boon suggest&#172; ed that the alterations of the agenda have been made with a sort of collusion of the British delegation to recognize the new regime in Manchoukuo, There isn&apos;t the slightest foundation for this. We have no knowledge of any such negotiations. We believe that you can plc.co no credence in that particular rumor. The reason the British delegation has been interested in these revisions was that the re&#172; action upon us of some of the questions was that we would be projecting Japan unnecessarily into a position of separation and unnecessary justification, I&apos;ve desire to make it clear to our Japanese friends that wo had no desire to sec them put in the dock. Regarding tho omission of questions a,, b,, and c, under Paragraph 6 of the Handbook, Page 26, it lias boon suggested that the British delegation moved for the deletion of these paragraphs because the idea contained in them was already being promoted and that therefore, wo did not want to have them discussed in this conference. It would be most unfortunate if wo approached this conference with any such idea, I should like to say that these revisions were made largely at my own suggestion, and my idea in making them was actually a pro- China approach, I felt that they vferc almost insulting to tho great country of China, as if we wore almost unmindful of the great human rights of that great nation, I hope that I have completely satisfied any of tho doubts on this question and that our real desire at the conference is to have a free and frank discussion by all countries on these matters. We have listened to a very powerful paper with regard to the expansion of export trade, and the reason for that expansion, by Mr. Oshima of Japan, We do not want to put Japan entirely on the defense and we rocognize that there is a great and human right of a nation to develop and expand in such a way as &quot;will on- able her to meet the legitimate demands of her people for a higher standard of life. We put the right of Japan to expand in this way: the right of an indivi&#172; dual to have all the freedom that life could offer in the sphere of light, emotion and hope, and any nation has this right. It is on the point of view as to whether that is the true objective of Japan that makes tho necessity of frank consideration of this question and we hope there will bd equally frank answers, I want to say a word or two on this question of motive behind tho expansion. The extraordinary tempo of Japan&apos;s advance impresses all of us. No nation in history has ever achieved such an acceleration as has boon achieved by Japan, The question is whether or net it is the best thing to force such a tremendous increase, because ultimately the pur&#172; chasing power of the dislocated markets is lessened and instead of reaching the objective you have set for yourself, you will find yoursolvos and your people beset by many of the difficulties of which you complain today. As one of our delegation has put it &quot;What wo firid difficult is that you are rushing like a bull in a China shop into world markets,&quot; That is one of tho very strong points that</essay:p>

            <essay:p>we want kept in mind during the course of the discussion&#174; On the subject of raw materials, from our point of viexv wo want Japan to have proper access to the raw materials which she needs and to have the right to develop the payment for this, but is this race of -theirs in their search for raw materials the only method of obtaining them? Let us measure how much of the expansion of the purchase of raw materials is for the sole purpose of in&#172; dustrial development or how much is for the provision of war materials and a preparation of a much bigger campaign than could be for expansion. The total charge for military expenditure for the year 193?. was 442,000,000 yen and in 1935- 36 the charge to the ordinary budget was 1,230,000,000, nearly two and a half times the expenditure for war than had been the case only 5 years before that&#174; If you look at the figures for 1934-35, 46% of the whole budget revenue was being ex&#172; pended on the fighting services of Japan, and in 1935-36 it was over 50% of the .. total revenue. If loan-revenue be ignored, the percentage of military expenditures to ordinary budget revenue was about 75% in the year 1934-35&#174; And so we must ask how much of this drive is for expansion and hew much in the interests of the industrial workers, and how far in the interests of some other motive. Many people have said that it is not merely the economic urge which is behind this growth but that thoro is a national purpose in Japan today which explains this particular campaign&#174; I hope wc shall hear of this from our Japanese friends when wc actually put our questions to them. It may bo said that if the Japanese arc doing this, they are doing no more than what has been done in the past by western countries, and our answer to this is that they ought to have learned enough to avoid the mistakes which nations have made in the past&#174; Regarding expansion and export trade, on behalf of the British delegation, I may say that given proper conciliations and trado agreements, we sec nothing fundamental to object to. It was, however, this groat expansion for raw materials on the part of Germany which lead up to the last war, but after the war Germany became our largest customer in Europe, so looking back on that wc have no foar of your expansion in Japan, if it is net going to rebound on the Japanese them&#172; selves&#174; From my personal point of view, I was very interested in the opening speech of this conference made by Mr. Holland, to the effect that we should find the solution to these problems in internal and economic adjustments within our own countries, I dn not believe that you will over got true peace in the world until each nation is really preparing to tackle the question of internal social and economic adjustment. To use a cockney expression, &quot;mucking about&quot; with the exchanges will not accomplish this. It must be dealt with by internal and social adjustment. In Sheffield today we make more stool with one man than wo did in years past with five men. We feel that this wealth must be enjoyed by all the people and until the nations of the world are prepared to faco that you will always have unrest&#174; I would say to our Japanese friends that if&apos;their objective is purely to raise the standard of life of the Japanese people, I am certain that wo shall be able to arrange conciliations and trade agreements and generally will have como</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 17 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON JAPAN ROUND TABLE TOPIC II, AUGUST 20, 1936. (Yusuke Tsunami) I want to speak as briefly as possible about the main points raised in the four round tables on Japan. I am not speakinC on behalf of the Japanese delegation, but rather as an individual critic, so that when it comes to some expressions of views they are entirely my own&#8226; We had the great Dleasure of listening to Mr. Alexander of Great Britain in opening our discussions. How, with the permission of this speaker, who is m the front row, I should like to make some observations on his remarks. I venture to dissent to a certain degree from his statement in this vein: the percentage^or proportion he allotted to the appropriations for the Japanese armaments appearing in each year&apos;s budget I think is a little too large in proportion to the whole budget, in comparison with other states. For instance, the reason y ^ e pro&#172; portion of Japanese armament expenditure gives such a largo percentage is because we have a different system of budget making. In the first place, quite a num er of special budgets are not included in the ordinary budget, and also we have not, like ?n England, France er America, the interest, the huge amount of interest which vou are paid out of the total budget on the national loans raised during the war. When you compare these figures you will find tho proportion is not so alarming as expressed by Mr&#171; Alexander. In the second place, during tho course of discussion in the past three days there have been occasions of linking the expansion of Japan s trade with her in&#172; creased expenditures for armaments, but it seems to me that there is no connection between these two whatsoever. If you start connecting these two things, might it not occur to a Japanese that by buying the raw cotton^from America we are helping you build battleships? Therefore, 1 think the logic of trying to connect these two things is a little bit far-fetched, to my run &lt;, Now I have a rather small mount of time tonight, so I will try to touchy upon various points briefly. In tho ocond place I should like to speak on one impor- tant point, that is this: While I was listening to the very interesting discuss&#172; ions in the round tables I had an impression that &#8212; it might bo wrong -- that some people had the impression or feeling that Japan is separate from tho rest of tho world, as if Japan&apos;s case was something peculiar to her alone. But 1 do not think that Japan&apos;s case is so different. Japan&apos;s social unroot Is_Pnrt md or reel of tho-world&apos;s social unrest. Japan&apos;s economic rial-adjustment is a Dart* of the picture of the whole world&apos;s mal-adjustment, and the results of the rapid expansion of Japanese foreign trade are also tho same things that have occurrcd and aro occurring in different parts of the world, between nations and also within tho borders of one country, in different parts of that particular country. so I hope you will look at Japan as part and parcol of tiio picture 01 the whole world, and nothing particularly different in tho ease of Japan. In the third place, I want to call your attention to tho throe phases of Japan&#172; ese expansion. Wo have talked about its political phase, which &#8222;.v~ no , go into very much at length, and then we have had occasion to talk m detail a the economic phase of Japan&apos;s expansion into trade and industry. I want to pel out one very important factor in Japan&apos;s &quot; expansion, which wo did touch upon but in a very slight way. That is Japan&apos;s cultural expansion, wiic 1 goal &lt;*d objective of Japanese life. The height of ambition of Japan is to con- tribute something to the world stock of civilization, the heritage of mankind, bv her continued existence as a nation on these curious islands J turies. Japanese minds aro directed toward imbibing tte culture of the whole</essay:p>

            <essay:p>world and thereby creating some by the harmonizing of the different cultures of the world into a new fusion which we intend to return to the whole of humanity. In the fourth place I want to call your attention also to the fundamental causes of Japan1s expansion, that is, the pressure from within, duo to tho increasing population, out of proportion to its size of territory* We have tried to solve tho situation by internal adjustment, and those who have visited Japan will remember how we have succeedcd in tilling tho land up almost to the top of the hills, and yet, due to the mountainous conditions of the country we could not cultivate even with the most intensive system of cultivation, more than 15% of the total area. We have found out we could not elevate or enhance the standard of living of the people any more without some other means, and one was the migration of the Japan&#172; ese into foreign countries, Unfortunately those were mainly closed to us. The other alternative was to sell our manufactured goods in different parts of the world* Unfortunately this met with difficulties because of trade barriers, tar&#172; iffs, quota systems, etc. I want to speak more at length about the internal situation of Japan because without knowing the psychology and the physical situation of the Japanese nation at home you cannot lpossibly understand the nature of the expansion of the Japan&#172; ese race. In the first place, I should like to call to your attention this simple fact, that the Japanese standard of living is not so low as some people might have thought&#187; Those who have been in Japan realize that although we live in houses built of wood and covered with paper we are not living in a very primitive way. We may not all own Ford cars, but we still are happy with raising morning glories in our less expensive flower pots* We spend our money in different ways, sometimes less costly, but when you look at the expense of each household for education in proportion to the income of that house, you realize that wo arc not entirely benighted, hopeless barbarians. Also, if you visit Japan you realize,&#8212; I hope you do not misunderstand me if I say so &#8212; you realize the sense of security in the Empire. You hear about assassinations, but none of us will assassinate you if you come there. In Tokyo you can send your daughter of 14 or 15 alone in the street in the evening. You realize tho sense of order and neatness that we have. That is the nature of tho Japanese. Then the question, why these wars? Before we discuss that I should like to deal briefly on a very important phase of tho internal condition of Japan. That is tho now social reconstruction going on on a very large scale in much distressed rural districts of the country. Wo have in our Japanese delegation a very prominent scholar, Dr. Nasu, and I think some of you have had occasion to listen to his expression of that phase of rural reconstruction. Now, for instance, since 1932 wo have been engaging on a very large scale in what we call economic reconstruction plan for rural villages. We have created elaborate plans for each village, of which there are about 11,000, and about half, 5,500, villages of Japan have now those elaborate plans which ore in operation. This plan is in fact changing the structure of life in the villages. And then, the great burden that was lying heavily on tho shoulders of the unfor&#172; tunate farmers and peasants of Japan was tho tremendous accumulated debts which amount to over 5-gr billion yen,&#8212; how to deal with this was a serious problem, and the government is spending a great deal of money for the relief of those agrarian debts, and these villages are given, by creating corporations, the guarantee of the central government to change from very high interest debts from village money rentals to the loans of lower interest given by banks. Another interesting phase is the industrialization of villages, due to the abundance of hydroelectric power in Japan. Then there is the groat movement in Japan of cooperative associations. Out of &amp;gr million farmers wo have five million already incorporated in this cooperative association and cooperative credit association. This supplies money at no interest to the extent of one billion yen.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>I do not need to go into more phases of this rural reconstruction. Now I want to come to a more recent event, the famous February 26 incident, I do not need to go into the details of this story&#174; I .want to summarize the re&#172; sults of that uprising of some young military officers in Tokyo. Two outstanding things resulted out of this very unfortunate incident. One was this: that even when they shook the foundation of the country, they could not create a military dictatorship. In the second place, they could not suspend the working of the par&#172; liamentary system of government, Now we know that these two things are safe in Japan&#174; I must explain very briefly the psychology of those young military officers. It has been misunderstood abroad. These officers are mainly recruited from among the middle, labor and farmer classes of the nation, and living as they do in barracks with other soldiers have not only the deep association of their homes but are con&#172; stantly living with sons of other peasants. These young officers, so simple and genuine and single-track-minded, began to compare the distress in rural districts with the luxurious ways of living of a few people who had amassed money by indus&#172; trial expansion, and began thinking that by putting some important people out of the way, by changing the system of government and the economic order, they could bring blessing to the hard-working peasants. Therefore, although they were mis&#172; guided, their motives were genuinely sincere. That is why in the past, after a few unfortunate incidents they had to a great extent enjoyed the support of the peasants in the rural districts. But their last acts in February of this year made a tremendous change&#8226; On May 4 of this year the Emperor opened the Houses of Par&#172; liament in person and gave us an Imperial Rescript. Throe days later, on May 7, while the atmosphere of Tokyo was still tense with the distress of this unfortunate and bloody incident, a small, unpretentious and ungainly man walked up to the tri&#172; bune of the House of Representatives and began to make a speech of interpolations to the Prime Minister and the Minister of War. Nona of us expected anything extra&#172; ordinary to come from this rather old gentleman, n;:arihg&apos;his seventies, small of stature. Then suddenly this ppeech began to become one of the most historical speeches in the Japanese House of Commons* It isa very long speech, and almost at the end of every phrase he was applauded. Why? Because he gave vent to the pent-up sentiments of the majority of the Japanese nation, and in a very frank way stated the facts of these military insurgentice of the past and present. At the end of the speech he severely criticized the interest of military people in poli&#172; tics, and stated: &quot;Mr. Minister, I want to express the sentiments of the -whole nation. The whole nation is indignant. There is a limit to the patience of the nation, and I want you to realize, although you might not have heard, because wo are not free to talk outside of this House, but I am going to tell you frankly that the people are indignant, and you should take stops to rectify this condition in the army.&quot; When he ended I realized that Mr, Saito had made a historical speech. The most surprising thing was not merely this speech but the answer he evoked from the Minister of War. General --&#8212;-&lt;&#8212;--- walked up to the Tribune and said, &quot;I have listened with intense respect, and I agree with the statement of Mr, Saito,&quot; and you can imagine the ovation these two men received in the House, and the next day the newspapers of the country, of which there are quite a few, carried a whole page of these speeches. The present Minister of War is attempting the &quot;rectification of the army movement,&quot; Now I want to make a very brief excursion into a forecast of the future. The point is this: Will Japan close her eyes to the world and walk on the path of isolation, politically and economically and intellectually? Ladies and gentlemen, if you would kindly study the history of the Japanese nation for the past thirty centuries you will realize that we have passed more serious crises than this, arid wo have passed always with a renewed interest in the whole world. The restoration of 1868 was started with the violent movement for closing the doors against the foreign barbarians, I do not think that Japan will walk the</essay:p>

            <essay:p>path of isolation# In the second place I want to call your attention to a very simple thing# &quot;When you lock at a foreign country, particularly when you do not read the language of the people, you are prone to place too much stress upon extreme sides of the pic&#172; ture. Now I lament the great importance, too much importance, placed upon the extreme views now in print or in oral expression about the Japanese&#8226; For instance in reading the most interesting and most penetrating, excellent data paper of Sir Frederick Whyte, I take exception to his placing so much importance on the extreme view of KODO or the imperial way of government# I do not think that is the great&#172; est thought of the Japanese nation at the moment. That, however, ife entirely ny individual ,view# ...How. the Japanese traditional policy has always been to accept the superior points in assorted cultures. We even now revere the name of Confucius and the Great Buddha. The debts we owe to the great nations on the Asiatic con&#172; tinent, China and India, are heavy. In the past three-quarters of a century our debts to western people have been very great, and we do not forget our gratitude to them. Therefore, I do not think the majority of the people follow the lines of isolation. D0 you realize the extent to which Japanese public education has gone? At present the illiteracy of the Japanese is less than 4g^. Ninety-nine and one-half percent of the children from the ages of 6 to 12 are attending schools. That is the basis on which we demand the great nations to treat us as their equals and their sisters. Now what about the Japanese liberals? Who wore they who were assassinated? Liberals. Who are now fighting at the risk of life in Japan? So-called liberals. And if you could road Japanese books, etc. you would realize that i/ve arc not like some countries of Europe. We still have liberal traditions of thought. The liberal? politically demand the maintenance of the parliamentary system of government. Economically they are demanding more and more socialistic legislation of the country. In this connection I may say at present there are many things that even the well wishers of Japan are not happy about and are not satisfied with, and I must confess there are and have been a number of things in the countries which I admire so much, France, England, and the United States of America, or China, there are things even in these countries which wo cannot quite agree with. Therofore, I know that there o.re many things on which you can&apos;t agree with us, but I want to conclude my disjointed talk with this: We Japanese aro now passing through the throes of internal reconstruction, and I hope the friends in the outside world, the well-wishers of the peace of the world will have patience and sympathy for us, who partly due to geographical situation have been meeting with these difficulties, and partly to the exigencies of the time aro facing tho serious task now before us.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 193G Document 18 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON JAPAN ROUND TABLE TOPIC II, August 20, 1956 (Sir Kenneth Wigram) I cannot tell you how shy I feel at my presumpticn, as a mere soldier in addressing this audience of experts, most of whom have forgotten more than I ever knew* It is some consolation, however, to me to recall that somewhat trite definition of the genus Expert, namely, the man who knows more and more about less and less. My feelings are, I imagine, not very dissimilar to those of Daniel when cast into the lions1 den, though I am afraid that no lion who may be tempted to devour me will get even half a meal off me. Now let me try, if I may, tc summarize the impressions I have got from the discussions of the past three days, but before doing so I should like to thank the members of my round table, and particularly the Japanese members, for the high standard of the discussion and for the free v/ay in which opinions were expressed. As I saw it,the main theme running through the agenda was Japanese expansion and the effect such expansion was having on other nations. My first reaction to that was that a nation like Japan has not gratuitously put her&#172; self in the wrong vis-a&#8212;vis other nations, thereby causing herself a sense of loneliness, and for all practical purposes, cf isolation, without some very good reason. The first thing to do, therefore, was to attempt to discover the causes which prompted her to take the action she did, for until those causes were diagnosed it was surely futile to attempt to apply a remedy to the problems which ensued. Generally speaking, the causes may be described as political, in which I include security requirements and defense generally, and economic. Subsidiary to both these main causes are the psychological and historical factors which in some curious way seem to influence, and at times to a very great extent, the course of political and economic policy. In any case they are both very important auxiliaries and form, if I may use a mili&#172; tary expression, the supports and reserves. Cn the economic side I feel that we should regard the problem not primarily as one of Japanese expansion but as part of the problem of world conditions as a whole. If these conditions had not been so abnormal during the past decade I doubt whether Japanese expansion would be a matter of such world wide concern, I have no intention of enumerating the political and strategical factors which have contributed to this policy of expansion. Suffice it to say that they did exist and in the eyes of Japan were of sufficient import&#172; ance to demand immediate attention. The methods by which Japan elected to give them that attention, and the subsequent menace in which she implemented her policy, are quite another matter, and although these methods might have been the fashion in the 19th century, and are even being practised in that highly civilized continent, Europe, at the present day, they are</essay:p>

            <essay:p>no longer fashionable except with the promoters, and are inclined, to offend. the susceptibilities of the world at large. On the economic side I speak as a child, but reenforced by the knowledge that in the comity of economists there is no general staff, and consequently no doctrine, and that by an astute weaving of words principles can be interpreted in more ways than one, and so I take my courage in both- hand s &#8226; I am greatly struck at the desire evinced by a large number of members of every delegation to accept free trade as the most effective way of restoring the equilibrium, I have always imagined that the prosperity &#8226;f an individual country, in fact the prosperity of the world as a whole, is largely dependent *n the volume of international trade# And yet what do -*&#8226; see around me? Every artifice and every device to restrict the normal flow of that trade by tariffs, by quotas, by subsidies. These, I realize, can be and are justified by the peculiar conditions pertaining in various parts of the world. The question I ask myself is: Are such expedients, which after all benefit only a portion of the community at the expense of the remainder, really sound? To come back to Japan, are we not inclined to set up Japanese trade expansion as a bogey and to lose our sense of proportion and per&#172; spective? May not the real trouble be due to the fact that it came as a surprise to a distressed and dislocated world? Again, may I assume my former existence and draw an analogy from military affairs? I need not dilate on the value of surprise, nor need I remind you of the greatest ex&#172; ponent of that weapon, Stonewall Jackson, whose motto was &quot;Mystify and Mis-* lead,&quot; and who, by the consistent employment of surprise was able to main&#172; tain his forces in the field against superior numbers. An individual taken by surprise, be he general or be he a politician, will, as a rule, seek expedients, will sacrifice rational thinking for speed, and will cften act in an irrational way. May not our discussions here help us to get a correct perspective, a better sense yf proportion? The real embarrassment to other countries lay in the time factor, for industrial communities must have time to adapt themselves to new con&#172; ditions created by the arrival on the scene of a nev;- and powerful competitor. &quot;What the world asks Japan is that she should realize this and should regulate her export development in such a way as to minimize the dislocation caused to other countries. There are also the questions of population pressure and agrarian distress. The former, though acute, now should, I understand, adjust itself in time. As for the latter, it will be for Japan to decide whether she can combine agriculture with industry in those small islands. The vexed question of low selling prices, connected as they are with wage rates and standards of life, which though fully deserving the attention they received, are a field into which I have neither the time nor the tech&#172; nical knowledge to enter. In the present temper of the world, we cannot hope for speedy restoration, and may have to wait a considerable time. That, however, need not prevent a constant search for amelioration and for measures which may rolicve the present tension, even by short-term adjustments. For example,</essay:p>

            <essay:p>there is the proposal to transfer the obligation to impose restrictions from the importing country to the exporting country.

            <essay:p>integrated family of peoples, and however &quot;bravely we asserted our self-sufficiency and independence, wo wore actually dependent upon one another in vital ways. It was impossible for .America to play with its silver policy, all in the confines of its own backyard. It was impossible for some nations to go off Gold and others to stay anchored to Gold, without causing deepened depression in other places. Tariffs, quotas, subsidies and the whole apparatus of modern commercial life wore found to bo sensitive to disturbance from without and to have external consequences of the gravest sort. The flowering of Japanese commorcial expansim seems to have come at a time when both its extent and its consequences were magnified in fact and even more In appearance. The years 1930 and 1931 showed Japanese trade at a low point. During the depression Japan prepared actively to take her place in the revival when it should come. This she did by an extraordinary revolution in her technical pro&#172; cesses, which enabled, her to turn out more goods at loss labor cost. Then, as the currencies of the world retreated from Gold, Japan followed the load and by devaluing the Yon again cheapened the cost of the goods with which she sought to capture export markets. In all this there was c nfosscdly no plan to upset the economy of any other notion, No speaker claimed that there was anything wrong in Japan&apos;s ambition to soil as much as she could, wherever sac could. Indeed, apart from several acute collisions of particular Japanese products with long established industries, as, for instance cheap cotton piece goods flooding the markets long rolled upon by Lancashire, there was a clerr feeling that Japan with her cheap manufactured goods, had been a welcome merchant, and the hope was repeatedly voiced that trade with Japan would continue to grow. Nevertheless, the questions of speed and dislocation persisted, Japan, it was claimed, sold her cotton piece goods at 20$ or even 30$ below the prevailing price for similar qualities when 10$ would have amply sufficed to give her all the competitive advantage which she needed. The consequence of this was that Japan not only preempted the market for the cheaper grades but seriously injured the market for better grades, with which she did not compete. Another Illustration of dislocation was afforded from the Netherlands East Indies, here a dramatic decline both in imports and exports was to be noted, Japan, a former large customer, protected her own infant industries behind barrier tariffs, thus cutting her imports while at the same time she marketed her exports in increased quantities in the Netherlands Islands, It is clear that here was a double dislocation. The Netherlands Islands were forced to find new customers among countries to whom they were not accustomed to soil, and at the same time were buying increased quantities from a country which was not in the habit of selling to them. From Japan&apos;s point of view the conflicts between her expanding trade and the local national recovery policies were entirely accidental, and the dislocations were only those which inevitably occur when a new commercial competitor enters the field, While some of the Western countries accept 1928 or 1929 as a normal trade year, manifestly it cannot be accepted as a general normal. Nor can &quot;recovery&quot; in Japan be taken to mean the same thing there as elsewhere. For one of the old industrialized nations of the West, recovery means the re-attainment of an earlier</essay:p>

            <essay:p>level of well-being. For Japan, a newcomer into the competitive field, it means setting the pegs farther forward. As one member of the Conference phrased it, to Japan it is Recovery plus discovery, which is the true standard of measurement. In general it nay be said that there was a general recognition of the legitimacy of Japan*s commercial aspirations. That she is a proud, dynamic people, desiring to do well whatever she undertakes, and that she is really serving us all as she cheapens the cost of production and distributes her skill and economy was agreed, Japan is entitled to the place in the commercial sua which her genius may give her. Such concessions, however, were safeguarded by questioning whether the standard of living of human beings should be depressed, and while it was generally agreed to be impossible to equate the various satisfactions which national taste and tradition led people to value, yet it was felt that the industrial system required various guarantees of employment and provisions against exhausted vitality to a minimum which should not be sacrificed anywhere in the competitive struggle. Such, then, was the outcome of the discussion of Japanese commercial expansion, viewed purely as a commercial phenomenon. It would have been less noticeable at any other time. It had the y.dsfortune to run at cross-purposes to many plans for national recovery, and while not absolutely extensive enough to be serious, the speed of its impact was too great for the absorptive power of closely integrated national economies into which it was projected. The special case of China naturally took up a groat place in the general problem. There seems to be a frank feeling on the part of Japan that ^hina is a special case, and a marked reluctance on the part of China to being so regarded, Japan, China&apos;s closest neighbor, feels that she has special interests there which she claims can only be protected by a strong and not unfriendly central Government,, She regards herself as justified in being friendly to autonomous governments which, while still a part of ^hina, are hostile in sentiment to the central Government and not hostile to what Japan has come to regard as her right in Manchuria, The. outstanding phenomenon in this conflict of views has arisen from the smuggling in Hopei Province, v-.here in the eleven months from August 1935 to July 1936 the national revenues of ^hina have suffered a loss claimed to amount to 136,000,000, a sum tragically needed by china if her reconstruction is not to be delayed and if she is to continue to meet promptly her external obligations. This smuggling is said to be enlarging in the categories of smuggled goods, and ex&#172; tending in geographical penetration, and to the eyes of the Chinese it naturally ha the appearance of an attack upon her administrative integrity which not only threatens her ability to arrange further needed rec nstructi m loans but emporils her ability to meet her existing obligations. To the Japanese claim that China s tariffs are so high as to amount to a prohibition of imports when the purchasing capacity of the Chinese is taken into account, C:;ina replies that while she has raised her tariff repeatedly since she acquired autonomy in fiscal policy, she has not yet reached an average tariff as high as that of Japan, The grievance, however, is not primarily commercial. Its political implications are obvious and are the components of the gravest controversy affecting the relations between these two great powers. This Institute can only hope that its researches into the problem have been helpful in permitting the gravity of the problem to be made clear. Patient and just Statesmanship must supply the answer.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Upon the political implications of Japan&apos;s commercial expansion, in general the Conference has &quot;been distinctly helpful. &apos;.&lt;e have all come to realize that something more than unobstructed access to raw materials in peace ti .ie is necessary if countries not wholly self contained cm be expected to feel secure, when the great exigency of War faces them. Fear is at the root of the trouble, a fear which cannot be exorcised by assurances or quieted by being blind to the realities of life in the modern world. It is an over-simplification to ask with regard to Japan or any other country, why they are arming. Modern war is so swift and terrible in its onset as to leave no time for preparation after the danger appears. Responsible states&#172; men must be prepared and no excuses are taken for anything so colossal as failure. The extent of preparation for war will be judged by each nation after it has measured its dangers and its needs. If Japan is industrializing and seeking independence in the matter of raw material, who shall say that her statesmen arc wrong, unless the united world has some assurance to give them against disaster. But one thing this conference has made very clear: that there is no security but collective security. How to achieve that is the quest of the Holy Grail, For a little while wo may depend upon our own strength and in pride and confidence pursue our own. course, but in the long run the end of that course is chaos, That is the implied lesson of every discussion in the Conference, and it is especially interesting to note that that lesson is emphasized in the con&#172; structive suggestions made- as the Hound Table was about to dissolve. The most notable of these had to do with temporary adjustments of existing commercial con&#172; troversies of one sort or another. It was proposed with regard to the weaving industry and the like that the Japanese enter into trade agreements in order to prevent collisions and disloactions. I hope that out of the data papers and deliberations of this Conference statesmen of our countries mil find it possible to take up actively the maturing of treoties which will answer some of these com&#172; mercial questions. Then it was the groat suggestion made by M, Sarraut that in view of the obstinate character of many of these controversies, particularly iiir, view of the problem of population as it affects the Japanese, the only apparent answer to the question is industrialization; in view of that, and in view of the dispute about the standard of living in various countries of the world, he under&#172; took to make the suggestion that there should be called two great conferences, one economic. Disregarding the failure of the recent one, taking a fresh hope, he felt there ought to be called a conference to deal with world economics, surveying the needs, the dangers, the conflicts, and undertaking to reconcile the difficulties which nations have in adjusting their trade as it expands. Then, he felt, there ought to bo called a World Disarmament Conference. Whether or not the approach to peace is to be through voluntary disarmament, whether or not some further con&#172; structive effort for peace is not a surer reliance than disarmament, may bo a debatable question, but the calling of two such conferences, and the focussing of the eyes of the world, upon the problem of colloctivc security as the answer, would seem to be in the direction that the world ought to move, and this eastern world, like the western world, would find its problems answered, by such a conference. It is no part of my duty as -Rapporteur, it may even bo a presumptive In&#172; trusion of the sentiments of an individual whose whole luty will be done when he has faithfully reported trhat others have said, but to me the problem of collective actir to assure peace with justice is the most inspiring task of statesmanship. My countr is not a party to the post-war system which aims to secure that blessing and upon the part which America can take now or hereafter in its operation my countrymen are divided, but to me, in the recent test of that system in Europe, Sir Anthony Eden was a knightly figure. The limits of possible concerted action may have been misjudged, but at least he tried to save collective security for the world, and I envy him his gallant action.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 35 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON U.S.S.R. - ROUND TABLE TOPIC III August 21, 1936 (Mrs&#174; Barbara Wootton) Ladies and Gentlemen: May I say first of all, how much I appreci&#172; ate having the opportunity of speaking on the first occasion on which the Soviet Union has participated in the I#;-P.R&#187;, and on the first occasion on which the topic of that country has occupied its full place in our conference&#171; The Soviet Union celebrated its coming of age and reaching the age of dis&#171;i cretion last year3 and wo are all glad to welcome this new young member of the comity of nations among those who like many states represented here, are weighed down with a greater seniority, I take this opportunity of welcoming the Soviet members of this conference&#169; I am going to open this enormous topic by picking out one or two of the salient facts which our friends have placed at your disposal in the data papers. Former experience with conferences encourages me to believe that not all of the members of conferences read all of the data papers; some read most of them; most of them read some. Perhaps I had bettor not go further. Let me ask you first of all to look over some of the facts of re&#172; construction which have taken place during the present period of planning in the Soviet Union&#174; Let mo ask you to remind yourselves that during the period from 1929, while the incomes of most of us have been regretably re&#172; duced, the Soviet Union claims that the income of that country has been ad&#172; vanced from 29 billion rubles to 65 billion rubles# Let me also remind you that over the same period tho amount of new capital invested has been mul&#172; tiplied five-fold. We are accustomed to the signs of uninvested and un- investable capital&#174; The Soviet Union faces that unfamiliar phenomenon, an apparently insatiable demand for more capital for more investment. Let me remind you of some of the achievements of the Soviet Union in quantitative rather than in monetary terms* One test of activity which will bo most con&#172; vincing is the tost of the volume of railway transportation. Anyone who has traveled on a Soviet train will hardly dispute any figures about the density of travelI At tho beginning of the planned period, 187 million tons of freight and 365 million people were carried in ono year. Six years later the railways carried nearly 3 times as many tons of freight and 919 million people* Progress in agricultural output is shown by an increase in production of the principal cereals from 717 to 901 million centners from 1929 - 35. In industry the output per worker employed has increased about 64 per cent, while the number of workers has approximately doubled*, These are only a few of tho high spots. To complete the picture let me refer to the data papers &#9632; about tho Northern Sea routo. There is described one of the most picturesque and romantic enterprises of the Soviet Union# Already vessels are regularly passing the full length of tho Northern soa passage. It is true that there are not very many of them yet, and one of the topics of your round tables will be to discuss how far that route has genuine economic possibilities# At least, the Soviet Union has demonstrated enterprise and virility. The first is the increased attontion to consumers&apos; goods which distinguishes the second from the first plan and which, I understand, the Soviet Union hopes will bo more particularly realized in the later years of the second plan. The first plan was the most Herculean capital enterprise ever undertaken. The second plan is showing a little more regard for some of our common human frailties</essay:p>

            <essay:p>which express themselves in the desire for the minor luxuries of contemporary life&#174; Second, I would call attention to the increasing emphasis on the development of the Far Eastern regions, and of the whole of Asiatic Russia. The natural resources of the Soviet Union in the Far Eastern region have hardly yet been surveyed. They are now beginning to be adequately explored and it soems likely that eventually the natural economic contcr of the Union will be East rather than West of the Ural Mountains, That, however, is look&#172; ing very far ahead. In the meantime it is significant to notice that the capital development proposed in the eastern part of the country under the second plan is four times as groat as the development under the first plan. That capital development is accompanied by a relative increase of the pop&#172; ulation in the Eastern part of the country. As a result of all of this it is commonly accepted that you have had a marked rise in the standard of living of the Russian and Soviet peoples# It is the claim of the Soviet Union that there is no natural or necessary economic limit to that rise. Lly colleague, Mr. Romn, who is speaking presently, may have something to say about this, and the economics of it will no doubt occupy some of the round tables. It is evident, at ]c ast that whatever limit there may be to the planned standard of living is not oppressive at the moment. Two features of tho whole planning I would like especially to em&#172; phasize. The first is TEMPO - our conception of a reasonable tempo of economic expansion. Everything in economics is relative, and nothing more so than the conception of economic tempo. The rate of development in the Soviet Union is certainly startling. In the old days tho economists used to talk, when they spoke with more confidence than they do today, of 3% per annum, as a normal rate of development of all the production industries of the v/hole world. In tho Soviet Union an increase on the order of 15 to 20% soems now to be regarded as tho minimum that is respectable. Second, the common economic assumption is disproved by recent events in the Soviet Union. This is the assumption that what is known as economically backward areas will be developed by tho surplus capital of other countries. This may have very important meanings for other parts of the world. Ono of the interesting topics of discussion is the extent to which this independence of foreign capital has imposed difficulties and privation on the Soviet people# In tho meantime, I think we academics have to thank the Soviet Union for at least providing us with tho supreme illustration of the capital&#172; ist virtue of abstinence I As a result of all of this, the Soviet Union comes into what we somewhat arrogantly call the comity of nations, and .comes demanding respect. The Soviet Union has acquired two of the current titles of rospect. First, they have very largo armaments, and second, they have demonstrated their power of borrowing money. If you wish to enjoy respect in this world, carry a gun and borrow moneyi Need I add that they have gone even further, and that they are now actually in thr front rank of tho world&apos;s producers of goldt 1 think that they have no more worlds to conquor. The next question is, are they going to have happy relations economically and politically with the rest of us? As to their trade relations, wo used to be uneasy about the possibility of happy economic relations with a country whoso economic and social life was planned, and whoso foreign trade was in the hands of govern&#172; ment monopoly. But it has been found possible today to conduct a trade of quite substantial volume between the planned and the unplanned community. Some of the burden of our complaint, v&#171;rhen we British moaned about the dif-&#187; ficulties of Japanese competition is relevant here. We found ourselves some-</essay:p>

The Soviet&apos;s own. theory about trade is that they will always need some foreign trade as complementary to their internal production# They look back on past experience and note that, as the level of the standard of living rises, so the amount of internation exchange has tended to increase* Exchange between advanced industrial nations, as in pro-war days between England and Germany, was on a very substantial scale* Again the Soviet Union could not easily be wholly salf-sufficient# When ^ had a discussion yester&#172; day with Mr# Roma as to the possibility of producing of bananas in the Soviet Union, I was interested to find that he was not unduly optimistic# Let us now look at the facts of the existing situation. First, Soviet trade has changed materially during the period of the plans, and that in accordance with the Soviet&apos;s own principles. They now import less machinery, fewer motor cars and almost none of what has bccome a sort of symbol of the ideology of Soviot Union, the tractor# Their imports turn to raw materials such as rubber and the more luxurious food stuffs&#174; This is going to produce problems for the rest of us# Trade complementary to your own production docs not necessarily mean trade complementary to the convenience of the rest of the world. In this connection, however, one should recall the Soviet attitude to the theory that, as every nation develops it will become choked with a surfeit of its own goods&#171; &#8482;he Soviet contention is that this will never happen to them because they have an infinite swallowing capacity. Wo in the old-fashioned part of the world had better perhaps stick to the facts of the present, and withhold judgment on the whole Soviet theory# The facts are that there is not yet any sign of a flood of Soviot exports. The Soviet foreign trade has shrunk with the foreign trade of the rest of the world, and it has certain tendencies to shrink even on its own account. Their main ob&#172; ject is to acquire essential .commodities, and the supplies of these at homo are far greater in the Soviet Union than, for example, in Japan# We cannot look ahead for more than 10 or 15 years, and I see no sign of a vast Soviet export trade in that time. There is another fact that the Soviet Union has to face# The population of that country increases by about 3 million souls a year and nothing that can be d one is likely to diminish that increase within a generation&apos;s time. I shall leave for later developments in the round tables the interesting allied questions about the digestive capacities of our various economic systems. I now introduce Mr. Romm.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 39 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON USSR ROUND TABLE TOPIC III,AUGUST 21,1936 (V. Romm) The U.S#S#R# group appears for the first time before a conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations; we come before you at a moment when our country has achieved much and is looking forward to achie\re much more. We have achieved a socialist society, a society, the foundation of which is public ownership, state and. also cooperative, collective farm property as the means of production, A society where there is no longer unemployment, no exploit&#172; ation, no oppression of nationalities. Our society has virtually become a class&#172; less one. In the political field these processes have found their expression in the further historical step in the development of a genuine democracy and a genuine freedom - the Stalinist draft of the New Constitution of the U.S.S.R. The rapid industrialization of the country, which has transformed it from a backward agricultural into an advanced industrial country, with a planned economy, has been accomplished solely by our own forces. In our construction work we had to overcome difficulties, both external and internal. The socialist construction was carried out on the basis of a planned and rational development of productive forces and opening of new resources. To under&#172; stand the significance of what has been achieved it is necessary to visualize for a moment what was the starting point. We had to start from extremely low levels. There were people in our country who denied the very possibility of building up socialism in our country. The Trotskyist counter-revolutionaries who are tried at this very moment in Moscow for a contemptible plot against the life of the great leader of our country - Stalin - were proclaiming the impossibility of successful socialist construction. Theirs v/ould have been a policy of internal and external adventures instead of the present policy of construction within and peace without. They were defeated by lack of any mass support and thus the very fact that they finally resorted to desperate acts cmd plots of individual terrorism is in a way a peculiar illustration of tho plenitude of our victories. The level from which wo had to start was very low indeed. Old Russia was a country with a very low level of general industrial development, an extremely low standard of living of the great majority, and with a lack of development of natural resources, a great part of which wore even hardly known. Russian and foreign capital developed only those resources and regions which could be most conveniently exploited for a direct and rapid profit. Besides the general lack of development, this resulted in an extremely unequal distribu&#172; tion of productive forces. Three-fourths of the whole industry were conccntrated in a few regions of European Russia. The greater part of the country was scarcely populated and was kept on a primitive level. The relationship between the centrcil parts of the country and its outlying regions was of a clearly colonial character, Siberia, Central Asia, the Caucasus, etc. were converted into raw material append&#172; ages.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>In 1921, Lenin wrote; &quot;Look at the map of Russia, North of Vologda, southeast from Rostov-on-the-.Don and Saratov, south from Orenburg and Omsk, north of Tomsk, there are endless spaces which could hold dozens of immense civilized countries. And on all those spaces reign patriarchial conditions, semi-barbarism and even complete barbarism,&quot; As early as in 1918 -^enin stressed the necessity of a rational distribu&#172; tion of industry from the viewpoint of bringing it near the source of raw materials. The great progress in the development of enormous new industrial regions in the east of the USSR is a planned development in this direction. The bringing of industry near to sources of raw materials is the economic basis of our national policy, a policy of complete political, racial, cultural and linguistic equality. Backward nationalities and regions everywhere are those that produce raw materials and possess no industry of their own. The rapprochement of the in- dustry to sources of raw materials eliminated any remnant of colonial relations and achieves economic equality making all nationalities and regions equal partici&#172; pants in the common work, thus largely by itself raising backward nationalities to a higher level. But this latter task is also the object of numerous special measures destined to accelerate the development of formerly backward regions. It is significant that in the draft of the New Constitution several republics, formerly only autonomous, or indirectly affiliated with the Union, are raised to the status of sovereign constituent national republics of the Union, In industrializing the country along the linos laid down by Lenin and Stalin, in raising agriculture to a higher level - of a large scale production on a collective basis and equipped with modern technical means - the USSR over&#172; comes the...historic inequality between city and village, raising the agricultural population to higher material and cultural standards. And the problem of the attitude towards formerly backward nationalities is but a particular case of the problem of the relationship with the peasantry. In our nationality policy we are standing on Stalin1s definition of the nation as &quot;a historically evolved, stable community of language, territory, economic life and psychological make-up mani&#172; fested in a community of culture,&quot; Among the developments described, the advance of the industry to the east of the country is of foremost importance. One of the most outstanding events is the completion of a second coal-metal basis in the East, - the Ural-Kusnotsk Combinate, not to mention other important industrial developments in the Asiatic part of the USSR. The development of the communication and transport system follows the same pattern as the development of industry. Incidentally, the industrialization of the USSR in general, and of its Asiatic part in particular, has strengthened its economic and military power and thus has strengthened its security and capacity for defense in the Far East. The ever growing power of the USSR cannot bo considered menacing for any&#172; body, Not only is the USSR opposed in principle to any aggression or expansion, but does not need any such thing. Our system contains within itself unlimited possibilities for the development of productive forces, for the progress of tech&#172; nique and for the increase of productivity of labor. At the same time progress in the USSR can never result in unemployment or overproduction. Our economy is not governed by profit but by the requirements of the masses of the people. The rapidly rising standards of living create unlimited possibilities of development of the internal market. The increasing production, under a planned socialist eco&#172; nomy, is and will be rapidly absorbed by growing consumption. There is no objective</essay:p>

            <essay:p>limit for the rise of standards of living and cultural standards. Therefore, it is unthinkable that need should ever arise even for a trade expansion, not to speak about other more grave forms of expansion* The USSR has achieved technical economical independence and foreign markets play a subsidiary part in its economic activity. The USSR is not dependent upon exports, unlike many other countries. At the same time it is not refusing to develop economic, commercial, technical and other relations with other nations on a basis of mutual advantage. The aim of becoming a self-supporting and economic&#172; ally independent country, which we have achieved, has nothing to do with theories and practices of * self-sufficiency1 and * autarchy,T so fashionable nowadays in some of the Authoritarian1 European countries. We are not for economic isolation, and it should be borne in mind that exchanges between advanced countries are much more active and varied than between advanced and backward countries. The transformation brought about by the new social system in our country will become most clearly apparent if wo remember for a moment what wore the social setup and the policies of Tsarist Russia. The comparison, incidentally, will show how little truth there is in &quot;Geopolitik&quot; theories emanating from present-day Germany. Those theories would like us to believe that the policy of a country, its interests and &quot;needs for expansion&quot; are predestined and for all times to come predetermined by immutable geographic factors, independently from its social system. The Tsarist Empire, plus the present territory of the USSR, occupied the territory of Poland and Finland and the Baltic States. Thus it possessed even more territory than the USSR, And it was conducting wars of conquest throughout its history. It was the weakness of the internal market that prompted the policies of conquest. Agriculture was handicapped by feudal relations, the peasant was fleeced by the landlord, the &apos;wages were very low. One of the Tsar&apos;s ministers coined a startling phrase - &quot;We will go hungry but we will export.&quot; The huge country, with its vast empty spaces suffered from &quot;overpopulation&quot; and actively supplied immigrants to the U.S.A. at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, while the USSR, existing on the same &quot;geography&quot; takes measures to encourage the increase of population, which is growing at the rate of over 3 millions a year. Having an undeveloped internal market, Tsarist Russia preferred to &quot;expand,&quot; selling abroad goods which its own population could not afford to buy. It went from one adventure to another - the Russo-Japanese war, attempts to conquer Constantinople and the Straits, if not the who1e of Turkey, etc, - and finally went to its grave. This may be history, but its lessons aro useful. Just as it was natural for Tsarist Russia to be an active factor of ruthless imperialist policy, it is natural for us to have a consistent policy of peace. Perhaps one of the most interesting examples of the complete reversal of trends with the change in systems is the attitude of the USSR towards those count&#172; ries which in the past were objects of the imperialist and colonial aggression or domination of Tsarist Russia. The Soviet Union not only has tho best relations with those countries, but on the basis of its growing industrial power, is actively helping them in the development of their productive forces and in the attainment of economic independence.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The foreign policy of the USSR is thus a logical result of the working out of our whole system* It is - in Stalin1s words - &quot;a policy of preserving peace and strengthening commercial relations with all countries.&quot; ^t is based on the fundamental principle of peaceful co-existence of different social systems, recognized by the World Economic Conference of 1927. The foreign policy of the Soviet U?iion consists in fighting for peace, for the security of the USSR and fighting for universal peace. The fact that the USSR is in principle opposed to territorial spoliations and imperialist expansion, as well as the fact that - as has been already demonstrated by facts - does not need and docs not want political or economic expansion, excludes the possibility of any other aims in Soviet foreign policy. From this viewpoint the internal achievements of the USSR must be interesting for all friends of peace, because the growth of the economic power and independence of the USSR has so strengthened its military power that the USSR not only assures the security of its frontiers but acts as a moderating factor in the relations between other countries through&#172; out the world, making it more difficult to unleash war. The Soviet public opinion, although firmly convinced that the Soviet Union is well defended, and its security not necessarily dependent on outside help, and yet it is deeply disturbed about the dangers to world peace. The cause of collective security has suffered many severe blows. The outcome of the Ethiopian conflict and the failure of the League has to be partly explained by past Y/eaknesses of the League for which the USSR is not responsible and also by the encouragement of other potential European aggressors. The impunity of, and the non-resistance to unilateral revision of the European status by Germany was another severe blow. As a result we see at this very moment a new menace of the use of force, of armed intervention, of the explosion of new contradictions in Europe. Despite all this, public opinion of the USSR as before considers collect&#172; ive security is the most efficient way to preserve peace and thinks that the closer the danger of war, the more effective methods are needed to prevent it. The USSR is a consistent supporter of the League Covenant, which is not responsible for the fact that it is not being applied. The USSR is actively participating in collective security wherever there are prerequisites for it, wherever it depends on the USSR. The events of past years and past months again bring home to us the indivisibility of peo.ee. Peace in &quot;Western Europe is not possible without equival&#172; ent guarantees of security in Eastern Europe. And it &quot;would bo a vain dream to hope that without restraining European aggressors the Pacific could be pacified.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 19 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON RUSSIA ROUND TABLE TOPIC III, AUGUST 22,1936 (Honorable Newton W. Rowell) Mr, Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen; When in Europe in 1932 I made a special trip to Moscow to extend a personal invitation to the Russian group of the IPR to attend the Conference which was to be held at Banff in the following year. I was most courteously and hospitably received by Dr. Petroff, then the Chairman of the Voks - that is the society for cultural relations with foreign nations - and at that time he hoped and expected that the Soviet group would send a delegation to Banff. It so turned out that expectation was not realized, but in view of that fact I am sure you will appreciate with what cordiality the Canadian delegation joins in the welcome to our Soviet friends tonight. We had hoped to welcome them in Canada. We were not able to do so. We join with the others in the welcome to them now. When there I commenced to read the Moscow News, a daily paper published in English and edited by Mr. Borodin, whose name will be familiar to most of the members of the Conference. I was very much interested in it, and as I found they had a weekly edition, 1 subscribed for it and for the past four years I have boon a consistent reader of the Moscow News, so that 1 have been able to follow from week to week the development in the &quot;Soviet Union, economic, cultural and other&#172; wise, and I have sought to increase my knowledge of the developments there by reading a great many books on Russia. The last one I delved into on leaving home was Beatrice and Sidney Webb?s book, to which our Chairman referred. May I say in reference to the Ihily News just one observation, because it does indicate some difference between the social and economic system in Russia and that which prevails elsewhere. I imagine that most papers in the United States and Canada give the public what the public want to read, being inspired by the motive of private profit, ond desiring to increase their circulation they cater to the public taste. In the Soviet Union the papers publish what the people think the public needs and you get in the Soviet newspapers the fullest public information about the government&apos;s plans, its achievements and the developments from time to time. It is more serious reading than the average Canadian or American newspaper and is very full of useful information to all those who desire to acquire knowledge of the Soviet. Now, tonight I have been asked to give some impressions of the round table discussions and in the time at my disposal I can only refer to a very few. May I say that one of the things that impressed me which was discussed at the round tables, although owing to the pressure of time and the magnitude of the questions of great and significant interest, very little time could bo given to it but one, I think, which occasions concern outside of Soviet Russia, was the question of the export of Communism. ^ur Communist friends said that Soviet Communism was a social and economic system and as such could not be exported. I think with that we all agree, but that does not touch this point which un&#172; doubtedly is a measure of concern in other countries, and that is the ideology</essay:p>

            <essay:p>behind Communism, I think we all recognize that ideas recognize no international boundry. The ideas, modified, it is true, in their application in the Soviet Union, of Karl Marx, existed before the Soviet Union was formed and even if the Soviet Union for any reason should collapse, would continue to exist* It ox-^ presses an idea of social, economic and political organization, and I have this observation to make in reference to it because I know in my own country and in some other countries there are different ideas as to how the matter can be treated. I venture to suggest that if one does not believe and accept the Com&#172; munistic ideology, the only way to answer it is to present a bettor one. I do not believe you can defeat ideas by force and I think one of the real failures in capitalistic countries has been on the part of economists or those who believe in the system to place a reasoned defense of their system as against the reasoned advocacy of Communism, and unless in capitalist countries we are able to present from economists and those interested in the problem a reasoned economy which will answer in the public mind the ideas presented in the Communist theory, we can not hope to maintain our existing system, and I throw it out as one of the most important and serious questions discussed in the Conference for those who believe in a different social, political and economic system from that which prevails in Russia. Another matter which I think impressed everyone of us was the remarkable record presented by our Soviet colleagues of the industrial development of recent years, including the industrialization of agriculture, and the not less notable increase in the military strength and defenses of Russia. No one could read the data papers presented by our Russian colleagues or listen to the full and frank discussion at the round tables without being impressed by the marvelous develop&#172; ments that have token place in Soviet Russia in the last ton years. Those develop&#172; ments, however, do create &amp; situation that must necessarily be the subject of interest and concern on the part of other nations and peoples. J-here are certain international implications and reactions which must inevitably follow^this re&#172; markable development in Russia. I shall but refer to two tonight. First: What, if any, will be the effect of this industrialization of Russia - the increasing industrialization of Russia - upon world trade and upon tho foreign trade activities of other countries. Now, we spent some two days discussing the remarkable industrial ex&#172; pansion of Japan and the groat increase of her foreign trade and the effect of that increase upon the foreign trade of other countries. When we came to discuss the question of the possible effect of the industrialization of Russia our friends presented, as I understood it, this point of view: First: Wo arc now self-contained and we do not need to export as in the past and therefore there is no absolute necessity of our pressing our goods upon foreign customers and flooding foreign markets; Secondly: If I rightly understood our friends, there being no element of private profit in the matter, there is no incentive on our part to press our trade upon foreign countries. And ono must recognize the foroe of those answers. They pointed out tho difference between the motive of profit in a capitalistic country, but I feel safe in saying that not all the members of the round table were wholly satisfied with that answer or that tho other nations of the world engaged in international trade can make their plans on the assumption that Soviet goods will not interfere with them and may not seriously interfere with them in</essay:p>

            <essay:p>in trade competition in foreign markets, and I mention it for this reason: During the past, when the Soviet government needed to import raw materials or they needed particularly machinery in connection with the development of the First Five-Year Plan, one recognizes thci it was essential that they should export goods in order to get the money to purchase the articles they needed to import. During that period, as we know, they dumped goods upon the market which in certain com&#172; modities seriously demoralized the market, I refer to two of which I have particular knowledge because they especially p&#8222;ffooted Canada - timber and wheat. This is the one point of possible apprehension: While the Soviet may not need to export at the present time because it is self-contained, while there is no profit motive to induce it to export, should any exigency arise whereby the Soviet wanted to increase its foreign credit in order to import foreign goods, by the complete control of export trade they have it in their power to place any goods produced by them in any foreign market in the world at any price they deem necessary to sell in order to get the necessary credit, I am not making any question about it, I am simply pointing that out as a possibility, but I think I should add this: That I would venture to think that the chance of the Soviet government exporting goods in a way that might seriously dislocate foreign trade would be much less if peace is preserved in the world than it would be if the Soviet government were faced with war and thereby com&#172; pelled to adopt extraordinary measures to secure supplies that were needed or establish credit, and therefore from the standpoint of peace I should think on the whole the standpoint of peace were better if peace continues than if world disturbances took place. Then the second international implication arising from this development is the remarkable growth of the Soviet army and the increased fortifications which have been established in Russia and in the Far East, When I vra.s in Russia talking to a well-known American nev/spapor corres&#172; pondent, he said to me that he thought the Russian army had the finest morale of any army in the world, I said &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Because,&quot; he said, &quot;every man would be&#172; lieve in the ideals for which ho was fighting,&quot; I make no comment on it, I simply pass on the observation, but that the Soviet is today one of the groat militarist powers in the world none will question, and everyone who is interested in world affairs, whether he welcomes or regrets the situation, must recognize that the Soviet today is one of the greatest powers of the world and must be recognized in dealing with international questions. Now, on the problem of increased armament and increased fortifications of the Soviet Union what are the international implications? We have had a most interesting discussion in the round tables on that matter. May I say to you quite frankly if the object of the Soviet is peace and to maintain peace, then I gather that the strength of the Soviet forces would bo a stabilizing force&apos; in the world situation. On the other hand, if the Soviet object is not peace, then one must recognize that the existence of those large armaments must necessarily involve a disturbing factor in the international situation. Speaking for myself, I am personally impressed with the view that the Soviet is inspired by peaceful intentions and I base that view on three grounds: First: the fact that the Soviet joined the League of Nations and has participated</essay:p>

            <essay:p>in this organization for maintaining world peace is to ray mind striking evidence of peaceful intentions * The second is the desire of the Soviet Union to conclude non-aggression pacts with other nations - and many have been so concluded, I can hardly think that If their desire was to engage in any militaristic or aggressive enterprises they would have been so anxious to conclude these pacts. And third, the progress which has been made in the adjustment in the issues which in the past have divided Japan and Russia - the fact that we know an agreement in principle has been reached on the establishment of a commisssion to deal with border incidents is a matter of great significance to us in Canada, with both Russia and Japan near neighbors across the Pacific&#174; We know the benefit of a Commission to deal with border matters. We have an existing Commission between the United States and Canada that deals with border issues. That Commission has been in existence for more than 25 years and has dealt with a number o f important matters to the entire satisfaction of both countries. Because of our own ex&#172; perience we in Canada are very gratified that in principle an agreement has been reached to set up a commission to deal with border incidents and we hope that the actual agreement will soon be concluded. And third, the agreement to delimit a certain area of the boundary which has been in dispute. And between these two and the adjustment of other problems, it is the desire of every friend of both Russia and Japan that any outstanding differences may be amicably settled and that both of these two great powers, with whom we all desire to remain 011 terms of friendship and good understanding, may settle all matters between them in a sense that both will feel just and satisfactory. We all recognize, however, the difficulties of the international situation and a suggestion was made that we could not hope to get a permanent solution of the economic problems, although temporarily arrangements might be made which would smooth the way, without efforts at a more permanent solution and I believe it was also discussed at the round tables on Japan and on Russia in regard to the calling of an economic conference. Whether the present is the time for the calling of ^ such a conference I don!t know# I am sure every student of international affairs must realize that the present tendency toward economic nationalism is leading the world backward instead of forward - in the wrong direction - and unless men in the nations are prepared to take the lead and stand for a better understanding in trade matters and freeing the channels of international trade from some of the^ obstructions that may prevent trade between nations, wo are in danger of slipping back into the dark ages. And I am sure everyone sympathized with the idea of some form of conference between the nations of the world that would put an end to extreme economic nationalism and start the world on the road to world trade. It was also suggested there should be a disarmament conference. I donft know, in view of the past failures, whether it is possible to convene a dis&#172; armament conference at the present time that could obtain any practical results, I am afraid some matters in Europe - maybe some in the Far East will have to be adjusted before such a conference can be held, but surely no lover of his kind &#8212; no one interested in human progress or human welfare can view but with the gravest apprehension the rise in armaments today, and surely it is the part in the countries from which we come to create the atmosphere which would make possible international cooperation leading to infcernational understanding and a measure of reduction in international armaments.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 20 STATJ&amp;SiJT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON RUSSIA ROUND TABLE TOPIC III, AUGUST 17, 1936. (V, Motylov) The USSR Group is extremely pleased with the scope and the direction of the discussions which for two days have been centering on the internal and external policies of the USSR. The USSR Group is under the impression that the fundamental idea which the USSR wanted very much to make clear has met with a considerable measure of understanding and response* It is the idea that the internal development of the USSR excludes the necessity for any sort of expansion and that the peace policy of the USSR is not only a matter of principle and program but the external re&#172; flection of the nature of its internal development&#174; Even any necessity for a foreign-trade expansion is eliminated by our development as our socialist economic system is not in nood of foreign markets and does not depend on them. Our policies within the country as well as our peace policy abroad, are both established on the unshakable foundation of the conscious and wholehearted support of the hundred and seventy million population of our country* The creative initiative of the peoples of the USSR and the rapid rise of their cultural levels, manifested in the spirit with which they have worked and acted during the years of Socialist construction, are a most important feature of our development* Without this creative initiative wo would not have been able to accomplish what we have accomplished. One of the most typical features of this creative initiative at the present stage are the great successes in the mastering of the new technique, in the rise of technical skill and in the further rise of cultural levels. The spontaneous development of a new movement among our workers which aims to got out of industrial technique everything it can give is an important development in this direction* This movement, which is being called &apos; Stakhanovism* creates prerequisites for a great increase in the productivity of labor, of a further acceleration of the tempo of the economic development, and of an accelcratec growth of material well-being of the population. This movement means that the basis of the distinction between mental and manual labor is being undermined. If the elimination of the inequality between mental and manual labor is still a matter of a future, though not too distant, there Is another historical inequality the elimination of which is approaching its fulfillment. The historical inequality between city and country, between the industrial material and cultural standards and the standards of the village - is being gradually overcome on the basis of a collectivized and mechanized agriculture. The traditional inequality between industry and agriculture has been broken also in another sense. If until recently the tempo in the development of agriculture did not correspond to the rapid pace of the industry - during the last two years</essay:p>

            <essay:p>thcro has boon a changc in this rcspect also, a change, accomplished on the basis of the large-scale collective fanning. The percentage of the increase of the gross-production in agriculture, compared with the previous year, has been in 1935 - 11 per cent and in 1936 is going to bo 24.2 per cent, while corresponding increases for industry for the samo years are respectively 20,7 and 23.0 per cent. At the end of the Second Five-Year Plan (1937) the gross production of agriculture will havo doubled compared with 1932. And it is known, I assume, that wo have the habit of fulfilling our figures, and sometimes of over-fulfilling them. This accelero-tion of the tempo of the development of agriculture creates a new basis for the acceleration of the growth of the whole national economy. The political expression of the internal social and economic changes in the USSR is represented by the draft of the new Constitution of the Soviet Union. This Constitution firmly anchors the state, cooperative and collective farm property as the economic foundation of the new social order, ^he Constitution guarantees full political equality of all stratas of our virtually classless society, The Constitution is also a further important stop towards the equal&#172; ization of the cultural activities and material wealth of the numerous nations of the USSR, so numerous indeed that the USSR could be called a socioty of Nations in itself. We are very much satisfied by the considerable interest shown by membors of this Conference for our new Constitution. In our opinion our Constitution provides for the most consistent and complete democracy. Still, the question was raised as to the extent of guarantees of political rights and civil liberties as compo.rod to democracies of an older &quot;typo. We would be quite prepared to go into this subject in every detail but, as one of the members of our delegation has pointed out today, this would load us to questions such as the compatibility of economic inequality and unfreedom with juridical equality and formal political freedom, and the mutual working out of these contradictory phenomena. If wo Would go into this argument this might bring us into regions dangerously bordering on what some people choose to call Communist propaganda. And as we have no intention whatsoever to evangelize or propagandize - we rather prefer understatement to overstatement. May I add just this, namely our firm belief that the progress of genuine democracy in our country is by itself encouraging for friends of peace and democracy in a world threatened by non-peaceful changes and social reaction. Allow me now to pass to the international aspect of the debate on topic Number Three (USSR). May I, first of all, express my gratification about the fact that distinguished Japanese delegates have extended their assistance to our efforts to make clear to all of our colleagues that there are no insoluble con&#172; tradictions between Japan and the USSR and that widespread beliefs that a conflict is inevitable are erroneous, and that as far as there are pending questions be&#172; tween the two countries, there is no impossibility to solve them in an entirely peaceful way - if the spirit will prevail which I saw in some of the speeches of the round table I attended today. There I could see that a correct estimation and a deserved recognition was given by statesmen of great European nations in their statements to the idea, of which my friend Romm reminded us yesterday. I mean the idea of the close inter-dependence of peace in all parts of the world, in particular of peace in different regions of Europe and Asia. This is the more important, as at the same time we heard another statement to the effect that not only at present but in the future as well it is unthinkable that Japan would</essay:p>

            <essay:p>concluclc with Germany any aggrossive agreements or alliances directed against the USSR. If we aremember for a moment that Nazi Germany is the main aggressive force in present-day Europe, we will realize the importance of this statement* Is it possible to doubt the good faith and the good will of a distinguished Japanese statesman whose signature stands under the diplomatic document which created the basis of the normal relations between the USSR and Japan? But is it possible, on the other hand, to doubt also that, as Stalin pointed out recently (in his interview with Roy Howard), the enemies of peace work secretly# The fact that such aggressive coalitions do not correspond to the desires or the information of this or that friend of peace, unfortunately, does not prevent enemies of peace from going very far in their destructive, secret work, which tomorrow may become visible to all&#174; As far as we are concerned, we consider that the sooner the friends of peace will become conscious of the reality of aggressive preparations already made and of some 1 cooperation1 already working - the better will it be for the cause of peace* In this debate, which confirmed to the Pacific Institute of the USSR the usefulness of such an exchange of opinions, in which we participate for the first time, more clarity was introduced also in the understanding of other aspects of the international policy of the Soviet Union. If in the process of this exchange of opinions the understanding has been strengthened of the nature of the principles of the foreign policy of the USSR, and in particular of the unshakable character of its principle of respect to the rights of other nations to independence, self-determination and equality of security, and if the understanding was strengthened that the economic growfch, and the development of democracy in the USSR, and - last but not least - the military- power of the USSR correspond to the interests of lasting peace - the Yosemito Conference, from our viewpoint, already in its first part, will have made its contribution to the cause of universal peace.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1930 Document- S7 _ ^ 38 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON U.S.S.R. R0UN3 TABLE TOPIC III,AUGUST 22,1936 (Mrs. Barbara Wootton) Mr. Alexander, Ladies and Gentlemen* I know that I have your sympathy. I have calculated that this topic has been under discussion for six and three-quarters^hours, and^it would indeed be an insult to the concentration of meat in those discussions if I were to assume that they could be effectively summarised by anybody - much less by myself - in twenty or twenty-five minutes. I know therefore that all the rapporteurs in their turn will have your sympathy in the difficulties of their task. I have attempted to pick out four main topics which I think occupied the greater part of the attention of the round tables. The first and that which, judged by space, took least time was Mongolia. The second concerned special questions of interest primarily to Soviet-Japanese relations, ihe third covered those internal economic and political features of the Soviet Union which _ ;cicular. interest us in this conference. And the fourth was the groat and all important question, can we all exist happily in the same world with this new and strange economic system? I propose to say just a few words summarizing the content of other people*s arguments on these four topics. On the question of Mongolia we had some doubts expressed, from members of both the Chinese and the Japanese delegations as to the state of Soviet relations with that country. From a Soviet point of view the reply was given that the Soviets are interested only in technical and economic assistance to an undeveloped country, and that their aim in giving that assistance is only to promote the independence of Mongolia. Emphasis was made on the existence in Outer Mongolia of institutions which are regarded with abhorrence within the borders of the Soviet Union, such, for example, as the private ownership of herds and other property. Further doubts were expressed as to the situation on the Mongolian- Manchurian frontier. Some delegates thought that it was a little odd that, if both Mongolia and Manchuria were independent states, they should have to takie the assistance, each of a neighbor, in determining their respective boundaries. The members of the UcSR delegation disclaimed participation on behalf of the USSR in the settlement of that boundary but at the same time they laid emphasis upon the fact that there are certain situations which cannot be overlooked - at least by those &quot;who are near enough to them. On the whole Mongolian question I suspect that many delegates, like myself, derived a great deal of enlightenment by the speech mo.de by one who is particularly well qualified to speak, We learned first of all that the position of Mongolia in relation to both China and Soviet Russia has a very much longer and more complicated history than we might have supposed^ and few of us will ever for&#172; get the picture of the Mongolian sheep which feeds and clothes and houses and warms the Mongolian her &apos;&#8222;sman. I think the only part that that sheep does not play in the economy of the Mongolian, is that of entertainment. It may be that it was only pressure of time which prevented that aspect of the matter from being developed also.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>I turn now to the special questions of interest for Japanese - Soviet relations&#174; They arc many&#174; First, as to trade relations, one of the most hopeful things that came out of the round tables was -the optimism with which both Soviet and Japanese delegates spoke of the possibilities of Soviet-Japanese trade&#174; As to the developments, particularly economic developments, in the Far East, the view expressed by the Japanese delegates that these might have a rather menacing appearance for Japan; and it was stated on behalf of the Soviet that it is the policy of -the Soviet government to establish distinct bases of defense in the eastern and western parts of the country&#174; In reply to the Japanese, various assurances were giVen that nothing is intended by these armaments except security and defense and that (as so often is the case with armaments,) they were not direct&#172; ed anywhere in particular&#174; We did not carry the subject further because at this point it was perhaps beginning to canform to the pattern of a very old dis&#172; cussion - that is the argument whether the hen biologically preceded the egg&#174; Which armament first provoked which is a discussion parallel to the argument about the hen and the egg, but different in this, that whereas the hen and the egg are life giving, the armaments are life destroying&#174; The questions relating to the proposed Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact took a good deal of our time* The Soviet delegates expressed disappointment that the pact had not come to actuality&#174; On behalf of Japan we learned that two obstacles had stood in the ways First, the fear of misunderstanding at home&#174; In our rather strange world if two hold hands there is always danger of an implied assumption that they are proposing to arm themselves against a third party&#174; The second difficulty related to certain outstanding questionsof dispute, notably those relating to boundary questions between the Soviet and Japan* From the Soviet point of view it was urged that if you have already agreed not to fight, that makes a better setting for the settlement of boundary and similar disputes&#169; And as you have been reminded by the first speaker, there was common and pleasant recognition of the fact that steps arc now, we hope, effectively being taken to deal with the border question&#174; Wo then passed to the possibility of a Japanese-Gorman alliance. Here we left the world of actuality, and .found ourselves moving amongst the philosophers when we ceased to discuss what is and embarked on a discussion of the non-existent* Upstairs and down, in each round table, we had statements from the Japanese delegates that they have no knowledge of any Japanese-Goman alliance. It was indeed said that the Japanese would welcome economic cooperation with Germany. (We are still hoping that we all welcome economic cooperation with everybody else. ) Members of the British delegation expressed the view that any such alliance, since it would not be part of a collective system, would be viewed with dismay in my own country, and similar opinions wore expressed by an American delegate&#174; Comparison was made with the Franco-Soviet pact but great emphasis was laid on certain differences between that pact and a possible Gorman&#8212;Japanese alliance, notably in the two facts, first that the pact lies within the framework of the League, and second, that it was a regional agreement; whereas it would indeed require a considerable flight of the imagination to say that any Gorman- Japanese pact was of a regional character* It was I think a very happy feature of the conference that just at this stage, when those particularly difficult matters were under discussion, the pro&#172; posal for a world economic conference was warmly supported by our friends from Japan.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Wo pass now to the general economic and political problems of the Soviet Union, I think that a certain disappointment was felt in some of the round tables that the conflict between the Communist theory was the planned state is immune both from satiation and from unemployment, and the non-Communist theory that those are ills and all flesh is heir to, was not fully treated&#174; I regret very much the impossibility of treating it# A groat many volumes have been written on the sub&#172; ject, and 1 know that the members of the conference would not wish me even to give a digest of the contents of those volumes. Very shortly, I take it that the basis of the Soviet claim is that since they control both their production and the incomes of their people, so as their production increases, they will arrange for the incomes of their people to rise in like measure# The contrary criticism from the non-Soviet world fastens particularly upon two things, first, that fluctuations of trade are prior to the capitalist system, and that until the contrary is proved, we must expect them to last even after that system has passed away; and second, that the Soviet need to export might, at certain times, be powerfully influenced by their demand for essential imports. Further the Soviet stands in a peculiar position in so far as that mystery of the economic text books, the cost of production, has no comparable meaning in their own country# That may have its advantages, at least to the Soviet Union for the common charge of dumping which is generally brought by any defeated compe&#172; titor against Ms victors may be rebutted by the Soviet economists in so far as their whole conception of cost is different# If you have no cost in terms of capitalist calculation, you cannot be accused of selling below it# These, however, are rather academic and abstract matters, particularly, I think, in the eyes of those whose views on the topics tend to be of a more concrete and practical character and to be expressed in terms of say, lumber or wheat, arid I shall not be able to say more on this except just to remind you that the saying of Bernard Shaw is still true unhappily, &quot;All the economists in the world, if they were put end to end, would not reach a conclusion,&quot; Some of us perhaps still hope that the stature of the Soviet economists would be great enough to bridge the gap. Passing to the political questions, those .X think I may deal with very shortly, for Mr, Rowell and Dr, Motylev both touched upon them# Much interest was shown in the new constitution of the Soviet Union, and questions were asked and answered, particularly in relation to the rights of free speoch, free association, of voting and of religious freedom# The chief thing that appeared to me to emerge from those discussion was this: that these freedoms must be regarded both in their verbal context in the constitution itself, and in their historical setting. More than that I hardly like to say, particularly when speaking in the U,S,A# in the presence of many American citizens and distinguished American lawyers - for the interpretation of constitutions is an art in which no Briton will compete with an American public# Finally I come to the problems of the coexistence of Soviet and capital&#172; istic systems in the same world# Here, apart from the economic differences upon which I have touched, the major issue would appear to be that which has been described as the question of the 1exportability of Communism#*</essay:p>

            <essay:p>My first advice to those who are considering whether Communism is an exportable article would be to look into their own hearts and to study their ex&#172; perience during the past week# They will there, according to their own experience, find an answer# All, I think, were agreed that Communism has this in common with other articles in the export trade - economists would include it in the invisible exports &#8226;&#8226; it has this in common with other articles, that it cannot be sold where there is no demand# Its appearance upon the markets of the world was widely noted, but we were reminded by our friends from the Soviet Union that in that country - tlx; words are mine, but I hope I express their thought accurately if in different form - we were reminded that in their country foreign trade is a state monopoly and that the article Communism, however it may appear upon the markets of the world, is not included in the exports of the Soviet foreign trade monopoly. I don&apos;t think that we wont further into the question whether there should be an inquiry into smuggling from the Soviet UnionJ Those, ladies and gentlemen, appear to me to be some at any rate of the outstanding lessons which, I as one of the receptive members, learned from attend&#172; ance at the round tables&#174; One last note I would like to strike -which might be perhaps a little Core personal. I have tried to observe the objectivity of the character associated with that of rapporteur# I doubt if I havo succeeded but I have tried, and I ask you to lot me say one last thing in my own capacity. The significant feature of all these discussions was, I felt, the atmosphere of willingness to cooperate. I was at Geneva in 1927 at the World Economic Conference and at that time represen&#172; tatives of the Soviet Union were participating for the first tijne in a conference of -that type. How much our attitude has changed since then; How different is the tone of our criticism! While criticism remains, on all sides the atmosphere in our round tables, from East and West, was one of willingness to lead toward mutual understanding and cooperation. As I put these thoughts together this afternoon in my cabin 1 heard sounds which made me think for a moment that war had broken out both upon the Atlantic and upon the Pacific# I refer to the contests that were talcing place on cach side on the baseball field# But I was mistaken. How different was the atmosphere in&#172; doors from that which prevailed out of doors! And one fact of the discussion in&#172; doors was continually in my mind. All of us who are collected hero are representa&#172; tives of nations signatories of a pact which has renounced war as an instrument of policy. Sometimes as I listened to our discussion on strategy and related matters I thought that a little reflection on that fact might put our discussions into a due proportion, and I am sure that what took place in our Soviet round tables was a very real and sincere attempt to take our peaceful obligations seriously.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document ol STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION OH CHINA i Round Table Topic IV, August 24, 1936 (T. A. Bisson) In the round tables of last week, some of you may have noticed that whenever the discussion approached North China and smuggling, the barometer pointed toward storm. As I understand it, the chairman - no doubt with the kindest intention in the world - has merely asked me to take up these and rolatod political issues, and expatiate on them at some length. Under the circumstances, I can only take my courage in both hands and deal with the offer in the spirit with which it was tendered. If I speak frankly and unreservedly, I trust that the impartiality with which I shall attempt to aim my shafts will help to mitigate whatever offense may be unintentionally given. Perhaps on no other subject under consideration will complete frankness tend more to con&#172; tribute to an understanding of differing points of view, and so facilitate the possibilities of mutual adjustment. Before embarking on a consideration of the military-political phases of Japanese expansion in China, it is necessary to make clear that foreign expan&#172; sion in China is not merely a thing of today - it has a history. I am more inclined to stress this point because at one of the previous round tables, mem&#172; bers of my delegation advanced the claim, if I understood them correctly, that there is something in the American system which makes it fundamentally incompat* ible with imperialism. Now we Americans are inclined to pride ourselves on the fact that in our relations with China we have exhibited a marked hesitancy in infringing upon the territorial integrity of that country. But if we stop at that point, it is my belief that only half the story - perhaps the less impor&#172; tant half - is told. It is necessary to point out that only two years after the signing of the Anglo-Chinese Treaty of Nanking in 1842&#8212;the first of the modern &quot;unequal treaties&quot;--the United States had hastened to conclude a similar treaty with China, conferring similar rights and privileges on American nation&#172; als. The insistence of the American government at this time upon the most- favored-nation principle was an important factor in enmeshing China in a net&#172; work of treaty relationships which eventually generalized privileges infringing ChinaTs sovereignty to all the treaty powers. For our purposes, it is not necessary to enter into details on this issue. The data paper prepared by Mr. H. D. Fond of the Chinese delegation supplies the requisite information. Suffice it to say that under these and later treaties, including the Boxer protocols, American nationals enjoyed the advantages of the statutory 5% tariff (in actual practice often well under 5%) for some 60 years, and that at present American nationals are represented in the Shanghai Municipal Council, the governing body of the International Settlement, American nationals enjoy extra&#172; territorial status, American merchant ships ply China&apos;s inland and costal waters, and American troops and gunboats arc still stationed in China. So much at least must be said to keep the record clear on certain points of historical and contemporary significance. Similar rights, it should be added, are enjoyed by certain European powers and by Japan. But when we come to the present situation, I think that the facts support the drawing of a sharp distinction between Japan and the other treaty powers. Since 1922, these other powers have displayed a marked reluctance to extend their political, a s distinguished from their economic, rights in China. In some oases, notably in the matter of the rendition of certain concessions and the Weihaiwi leasehold, there has even been a retreat from political privileges acquired in the past. On the part of Japan, on the other hand, I venture to</essay:p>

            <essay:p>submit that there has seldom been witnessed either recently or in the past such a long-continued, persistent and large-scale infringement of China&apos;s territorial and administrative integrity as has taken place since September 18, 1931. Japanese military-political expansion during this period maybe divided, for purposes of summary, into five phases# At this date, it is not necessary to describe the process by which in 1931-1952 the establishment of Manchukuo was carried through&#8212;you will observe that I do not speak of the conquest of Man&#172; churia. Nor is it necessary to enter upon a description of the Shanghai hostil&#172; ities of 1932. The second phase began with the Japanese military occupation of Jehol province in March 1933. This drive was soon extended into north China, ending temporarily with the Tangku Truce, signed on May 31, 1933. By this truce a considerable section of northern Hopei province, from the Great Wall to a line drawn inland some miles north of Tientsin and Peiping, was &quot;demilitarized, &quot; i.e. Chinese troops were withdrawn. Under its terms, also, the invading Japan&#172; ese troops wore to be withdrawn from the &quot;demilitarized&quot; area which was to be policed by a Chinese constabulary force. This truce constitutes the starting- point of the situation which has since developed in North China, and is there&#172; fore, still closely tied in with current events in that region. It is to be hoped that one issue of fact, in connection with this truce, may be clarified in the course of round-table discussions. The Japanese affirm, and the Chinese deny, that the Nanking government made a number of concessions on May 31, 1933 which were not included in the published terms of the Tangku Truce. In this connection, I may refer to the Japanese data paper prepared by Mr. Ozaki, which states on p. 6 that &quot;such achievements in 1934 as the restoration of through traffic on the Peiping-Mukden Railway (July 1st), establishment of customs stations along the Great Wall (June 3rd), and resumption of postal communications between Manchukuo and China (January 1, 1935)&quot; were &quot;terms of settlement of the Truce.&quot; No such terms were included in the text as published. Since Japan&#172; ese political and military leaders have repeatedly justified activities in North China oil the ground of rights conferred by alleged secret terns of the Tangku Truce, it would be a distinct contribution if this subject could be cleared up in the discussions. The third phase occurred in May and Juno of 1935. Based mainly on ex&#172; pressed dissatisfaction with conditions in the demilitarized area, Japanese mili&#172; tary leaders presented a scries of demands to the north China authorities. These demands were backed up by airplane flights over Peiping and Japanese troop con&#172; centrations. A memorandum containing those demands dispatched by Lieut.-General Yoshijiro Umezu, commander of the Japanese forces in North China, to General Ho Ying-ching, War Minister at Nanking and then acting head of the Peiping Military Council, was eventually accepted, and has since been generally referred to as the Ho-Umezu agreement. Under its terms, among other things, the Second and Twenty- fifth Divisions were withdrawn, thus denuding North China of all regular Nanking government troops; the governor of Hopei province, Yu Hsueh-Chung, and his Fifty- first Army was withdrawn; Kuomintang party organs in Hopei Province were suppressed; certain Peiping and Tientsin officials were removed; and anti-Japanese activities were prohibited. Simultaneously, as a result of the so-called &quot;Changpei incident&quot;, essentially similar changes were effected in Chahar province. The fourth major phase occurred in November and December 1935. Since this so- called &quot;autonomy&quot; movement is fresh in our minds, it is only necessary to note that two new political regimes arose in North China as the outcome. On November 24 the so-called &quot;autonomous&quot; regime of Yin Ju-keng was set up in the area &quot;de&#172; militarized&quot; by the Tangku Truce. On December 18, the Hopei-Chahar Political Council, headed by General Sung Cheh-yuan, was formally inaugurated at Peiping. Since this latter Council is subject to strong Japanese influence, yet ho.s not severed its ties with Nanking, it may bo conveniently termed &quot;semi-autonomous,&quot;</essay:p>

            <essay:p>in tho sense to which wo have rocontly become accustomod to the use of the word &quot;autonomy&#8226;&quot; The larger five-province &quot;autonomy&quot; scheme of the then Major-General Doihara, which was also to include Shantung, Shansi, and. suiyuan, did not mater&#172; ialize# Our summary of this subject will conclude with the smuggling issue, as it has developed this spring# The economic phases of this subject are treated in data papers, and will no doubt be brought up by members of the Chinese delegation. I wish merely to comment on one issue. I understand that in one of last week&apos;s round tables&quot; an attempt was made to dissociate the Japanese army from smuggling. Let me recapitulate. Japanese troops invading North China force the establishment of a &quot;demilitarized&quot; area. The proper functioning of the Chinese police force in this area is prevented. Threat of military force enables Yin Ju-kong&apos;s regime to be established in this area. Japanese goods begin to flow through this area into China without customs dues or with nominal levies accruing to Yin Ju-kong&apos;s regime. Supported by Japanese military and naval forces, this regime disarms Chinese cus&#172; toms officers on land or drives them out, and prevents chinose revenue cutters from operating in waters north of Tientsin. In the light of these facts, I confess that I still seem to trace some connection between the Japanese army and smuggling. The broader implications of this military-political expansion are by far tho most important, inevitably the question arises in our minds: &quot;Where is this to end?&quot; Since 1931 the Japanese first line of defense has become -what might be termed a &quot;moving&quot; phenomenon. First, it was the three northeastern provinces; these required Jchol and &quot;the Great Wall, which in turn required northern Hopei and Eastern Chahar. As we take part in discussions noro, wo learn that the Manchukuo commander, Li Sliou-hsin, is advancing into suiyuan and fighting with tho Chinese forces there under Fu Tso-yi. From certain Japanese pronouncements, and from the three-point program elaborated by Mr. Horota, we gather the impression that the objective of this expansion is complete Japanese political control of China# If this be true what we are witnessing is a menace to the continued independent ex&#172; istence of the Chinese nation# Under those circumstances, I should judge that the course of the discussions would at some point turn to the methods by which the Nanking government is meeting this fundamental issue# Tho problem of if, when and how effective Chinese resis&#172; tance is to develop is present in the minds of all of us. Its urgency is reinfor&#172; ced to all those who, like myself, believe that a lasting poace in the Far East hinges 011 the development of a strong and united China# On this issue, I should like to ontor certain reservations as to the policies adopted by Nanking. In the light of Japan&apos;s continuing military expansion in China, and of tho total absoncc rf a functioning collective security system in the Pacific, it is necossary to judge Nanking&apos;s&quot;policies from tho standpoint of whether they adequately safeguard tho Chinese nation. I hope, as do all of you, that discussions in round tabic five will contribute toward finding a Sino-Japanese settlement through progress toward a collective security which will rule out the necessity of armed Chinese resistance. For the time being, howovo.r, that ultimate resort cannot be overlooked. In approaching this issue, lest seme of my remarks be misconstrued,^I wish to make it quite clear at the outset that I do not sharo tho pessimistic views com&#172; monly entertained in .rospect of China&apos;s immediate or more distant future. I do not believe thot the groat arid cultured Chinese people, with 2,500 years of re&#172; corded history behind them, will be overwhelmed. On the contrary, I feel that if tho attempt is made to press current Japanese policy to its extreme limit, the result is likely to prove a boomerang. At the same time, in order to f&apos;aco the current Chinese sceno realistically, we must candidly examine certain aspects which arc loss reassuri.ng than others. At this point I am quite consciously adopting a negative attitude, more especially bocauso the documentation and the contribution of the Chinese delegation supply the positive side.

            <essay:p>session, whose closc and accurate knowledge of the Chinese political scene I can&#172; not pretend to equal, is at hand to set no straight on points whore I go astray. The non-resistance policy faithfully adhered to by the Nanking government since September 1931 has, in my opinion, had certain unfortunate consequcncos. The whole of Manchuria was lost virtually without a struggle, and the ease with which Manchukuo was established invited excursions further afield. Demonstration of the possibilities of real resistance was left to the Nineteenth Route Army at Shanghai, quite inadequately supported by the Central government. The anti-Japanese campaign of Generals Feng Yu-hsiang and Fang Chen-wu in the summer of 1933, which succeeded in capturing Doloner, was eventually crushed as much by Nanking&apos;s intervention as by Japanese forces. Other items might bo added to this list. To those criticisms, the natural reply is that there were two prerequisites to effective resistance: greater internal unity, and a period of preparation in view of the relative disparity in military strength. And it must be admitted that this reply has undoubted force, particularly in view of the recent consolidation of Nanking&apos;s internal position, if we except only the continued existence in strength of the Chinese Communist movement. Nevertheless, the reply loads to a consideration of several additional factors. Resistance at this late date encounters the handi&#172; cap imposed by the loss of Manchuria and much of North China. Even more important, the exigencies of a long-continued policy of non-resistance have had unfortunate effects in the relations of the Nanking government with the Chinese people on the issue of the national emergency. I refer to three factors: the suppression of the boycott after the Shanghai armistice by government intervention; the muzzling of the Chinese press; and the suppression of tho student movement and its outgrowth&#8212; the national salvation associations established in many centers of China. On February 20 of this yoar, it should be observed, the Nanking government issued an emergency law which empowered Chinese troops and police to use &quot;force or other effective means&quot; in suppressing meetings, parades and propaganda activities&quot; which aim to violate peace and order.&quot; Since tho issuance of this law, as also pre&#172; viously, demonstrations calling for resistance to Japan have been broken up and hundreds of students have been jailed. This policy raises the question as to whe&#172; ther military preparation resides solely in actions taken by government at the top, or whether the morale of the people is not an equally important consideration. One further point, perh&#163;C&#163;&gt;s the most basic of all, as to tho nature of the in&#172; ternal unity which is being fostered by Nanking, ^he admirable British data paper on the reconstruction movement in China contributed by Mr. George E. Taylor lays particular stress on the point that the policies formulated by Nanking have been in the main carried through by and in the interests of the Chinese bankers, industrial&#172; ists, and landlords. Allied to this, he points out, is tho fact that political and military control at Nanking is today contered in the hands of one man, and we may note that the new Constitution scheduled for adoption in November vests powers in &apos; the hands of the President that can only be termed dictatorial. More than this, he emphasized that the dictatorship which today functions at Nanking has taken on cer&#172; tain aspects ince 1933 which tend more and more to resemble phenomena associated with Germany and Italy. In this respect, he does not refer so much to the abrogation of civil liberties, strict control of labor unions, or the drastic anti-Communist measures, all of which have been normal features of the dictatorship at Nanking since 1927. More alarming is such an agency of government as the &quot;Blue Shirts&quot;, a secret terrorist organization which has stifled liberal and left-wing opposition, suppressed labor strikes and unrest, and removed dangerous political opponents. Similarly, it is to be notod that labor conscription is sanctioned by Article 22 of the new draft constitution. Never wholly absent in China, labor conscription has of late years been applied under government auspices on a national scale, ox~ pecially in road-building and dike-construction projects. It is elements such as these present in the Nanking regime which lead me to maintain certain reservations with regard to the character of the internal unity which it has been forging, and</essay:p>

            <essay:p>with regard to the future effects of such a unity on China and its people&#187; After these distressing and delicate issues, I turn finally without any p, re at sense of relief to the subject - shall I call it the non-controversial subject - of Communism in China. For reasons of brevity, I have chosen to pre&#172; sent this issue in its positive aspects. Al.sojj I understand that the delegation from China represented at this Conference certainly cannot be accused of being wedded to the Communist doctrine. It may be, therefore, that I shall make some contribution by playing the role of the devil&apos;s advocate on this issue. In the first place, I should like to clear up one misconception. It is sometimes claimed that the Chinese Communist movement is something about which no certain information is known, and that therefore it is impossible to reach any conclusions about it which have a basis of fact. T0 refute this claim, I need only point to the lengthy bibliography on this subject which has been printed in the current issue of~Pacific Affairs. To those with the will to investigate, much may be discovered about it. I shallbricfly touch upon three issues: the basic program of the Chinese Com&#172; munist movement and its application in practice, the reaction to it rxiong certain sections of the Chinese people, and its present program and policy. The basic pro&#172; gram and its application may be best studied in southern Kiangsi and &apos;.&apos;o stern Fukion provinces, whore a relatively large and stable Communist base was maintained for six years, from 1928 to 1934. In this area, the following policies among others were carried into effect: a land redistribution favoring the poorer peasants and abolishing the great landlord estates, substitution of cooperative credit societies for the private usurer, enforcement of collective agreements for minimum wages and hours in local industrial enterprises, a graded taxation system bearing mainly on wealthier elements, elimination of the growing of opium, a&quot; literacy program for adults and youth, and founding of a military academy and university at the capital, Juichin; and the involvement of the mass of the people, including women, in poli&#172; tical life through active participation in a hierarchy of organs which reached from the local village Soviet to the center at Juichin. It may be argued with justice that this is not a socialist, much less a Communist, system, but the skill which the Chinese Communist leaders adapted their policies to the limited material basis at hand must nevertheless evoke a certain admiration. That thoir program, limited though it was, did involve a powerful thrust at the feudal interests of the Chinese countryside is attested&apos;by the virulence with which they were subjected to attack from the Nanking regime. This fact also bears witness to the possibility that under more favorable conditions their program right be extended much further toward a socialist goal. On the second point, it should be noted that the military achievements of this regime started from a point not much above zero in 1927-28, when the Communist forces numbered but a few thousand. Yet in 1955-1934, Nanking and the allied provincial authorities were forced to put into the field something like half a million men well furnished v*rith modern military equipment including airplanes to meet the Communist armies. In ihe end, Nanking only dislodged those forces from Kiangsi, it did not crush them. This fact evokes two comments. First, the Communist program must have corresponded to the needs of the local population. Secondly, it must have aroused their enthusiastic support and assistance, or this amazing military strength could never have been developed on such a poor and limited territory, both as to resources and standards of life* Theso comments are justified by the strict precautions taken by Nanking in the later phases of the campaign to insulate its troops against contact with the Communist populations. That this sympathy exists in wide sections of China is also supported by the evidences of peasant assistance afforded the Com&#172; munist army after November 1934, when it marched safely across half-a-dozen provin&#172; ces to Szechuan in the far west 0 The same phenomenon occurred in the North this</essay:p>

            <essay:p>spring, when part of the Communist army entered Shan si province. The peasantry- accorded them support, and even the provincial armed forces were considered shaky# It was absolutely necessary for six divisions of Nanking troops to enter Shansi, in order to drive back the Communist onslaught. Finally, as to current Chinese Communist policy. To meet what it considers an overwhelming national emergency, the Chinese Communist party during the past year has materially revised both its internal and external policies* Internally, its pressure on small landlords, richer peasants and merchants is being relaxed, providing only that they supply convincing evidence of support to the program of resistance to Japan. The core of its political program calls for a united national defence government and a united anti-Japanese army. Details of this now program are included in the manifesto of August 31, 1935, issued by the Chinese Soviet Government and the C. P. of China. The May Fifth Proposal of this year, referred to at the conclusion of Mr. Reizo Otsuka&apos;s interesting data paper, carried the pro&#172; posals of last year even further. The Chinese Communist Party now makes the follow&#172; ing proposals directly to the Military Affairs Committee on the Nanking government, of&#176;which Chinag Kai-shek is chairman: &quot;Immediately cause the cessation of civil war, hold a peace conference, and form a united front against the activities of Japan in China.&quot; An interesting statement as to its foreign policy was made by Soviet China1s Foreign Commissar in March of this year. In answer to an interviewer1s question, ho do dared: &quot;Our foreign policy is based on the principle of the freedom and independence of China and the safeguarding of the interests of the Chinese &apos; people....The chief enemy confronting us is Japanese imperialism, and the countries which preserve a benevolent neutrality toward our struggle against Japan are our friends, and we are ready to maintain frio rv.ly diplomatic relations with them based on equality. Our country is still backward economically, hence we must cooperate with those which are economically advancod. Therefore, the ^ovict government is prepared to conclude economic agreements, basoci on equality, with all countries which are friendly to us. The annulment of the unequal treaties is, however, one of the&#8226; post important foreign political tasks of the Chinese Soviet government. With the exception of Japan, this can be accomplished through diplomatic negotiations.&quot; In view of the evident expediency of this policy, we may assume that it is sincerely put forward# In conclusion, may I reaffirm the hope that the last round table will threw further light on these vexed issues that cast &apos;the shadow of war across the Pacific, and offer some means of escape from the dilemma which they present. May I also reaffirm the confidence which I have already expressed in China&apos;s ability to copc with its difficult problems. We all join this morning in paying tribute to the rich cultural heritage of China which is increasingly becoming the common heritage of mankind, and we welcome in advance the contribution which this groat people still has to offer to our common future.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON CHINA - ROUND TABLE TOPIC IV August 24, 1936 (Dr. Eu Shih) RECONSTRUCTION IN CHINA Our British Colleague, Mr&#8226; G. E. ^ubbard has defined Chinese Reconstruction as &quot;the evolutionary process which is taking place in economic, social and cultural spheres of China,&quot; The Chinese torn for this movement simply means &quot;construction&quot; or building up. It is reconstruction in the sense that what is being built up is actually remaking and reshaping the surface of an old country and the life of an ancient nation# Broadly speaking, Chinese Reconstruction has three phases - 1# the building up of a physical basis of national unity, 2* the improvement of the physical well-being of the people, and 3# the remolding of our cultural life for a better adjustment in the new world. All progresses in the field of transportation the railways- the highways, and the air lines - come under the first category of providing the nation with a physical basis for political unity# The sense of national unity, which now extends from Manchuli to Yunnanfu, from Kalgan to Canton^ from Shanghai to Tibet, is largely one of racial, cultural and ..historical unity. There has been lacking a material or physical basis to strengthen this historico-cultural unity and bind the various distant parts of the country more closely together. Chinese leaders early recognized the urgent needs of modern means of transportation and communicationj but unfortunately, ever since the outbreak of the World War in 1914 when foreign capital ceased to come to China on any large scale, China has made very little progress in railway building. It is only within the last few years that the Government has taken up the railway projects with now vigor and has succeeded in ex&#172; tending old lines and constructing new ones. The Lung-hai Railway is now extended beyond Si-an; the Shanghai-Hangchow-Ningpo Railway is being connected by the construction of the Bridge across the. Chientang River; and the Canton-Hankow Railway is now completed and will be open to^ through traffic this month. Of the newly planned lines, the Hangchow-^anchang Railway which connects the Yangtze Delta with the capital of Kiangsi and the Hwai-nan Railway which connects the Hv/ai River with the Yangtze, are the most important ones that have already boen completed. For the first time, we are having trunk lines running from Canton to Peking and thence to the &#9632; Northwest, and from the oastern coast westward into the heart of interior China. In the development-of provincial and inter-provincial highways, even greater progress has been made. The first modern roads wore started in 1920&#8212;1921 as a relief measure during the famine of those years. After the establishment of the Nanking Government in 1927, road-building was under&#172; taken with nation-wide enthusiasm. From the 1,185 kilometres of modern roads, the total length has increased to nearly 100,000 kilometres in 1935. In some of the provinces, notably Kiangsi and Kwangsi, the provincial trunk roads roach every hsien with local roads connecting all the important towns within the province. Again for the first time wo are now able to motor</essay:p>

            <essay:p>iu from Shanghai to anchang and Changsha and thonco to Canton* Commercial aviation has helped to connect the noro distant ccntcrs which have not yet been linked up by transports on land. One can now fly from Shanghai to Chengtu, a distance of about 1,300 miles, in seven hours; and from Peking to Chengtu, via Chengchow in Honan and Si-an in Shensi, in ten hours# Beginning with last month, one can breakfast in Peking, fly to Shanghai to keep a luncheon engagement, and return to the old Capital for his supper at home - a distance which usually takes 80 hours for the return trip. All this improvement in transportation is building up a new physical basis for a modern national state. When the Hwai-nan Railway was being built early last year, there waa a great famine in northern Anhui and there was no means for transporting the food stuff from the more plenteous regions, Tho starving population requested the railway engineers to make temporary pro&#172; vision for grain transportation bofore it was ready for passenger traffic. The request was complied with, and tho population was saved from starvation. It was the improvement in roads which greatly aided the Government troops in their final campaign against the Hod Array in Kiangsi in 1934. And it was also the modernized roads which enabled the Government to suppress the armed Rebellion in f&apos;ukien in loss than two months. The railways and highways are accelerating tho process of economic arid political unification. Under the second main category - the betterment of the livelihood &lt;__of the people - may bo grouped all those processes of rural rehabilitation, water control, formation of cooperatives, reforms in taxation and improve&#172; ment of public health. I shall not attempt to summarize the able treatment of rural economic reconstruction by my friend Dr. Franklin Ho in his data paper, in which he has given a very comprehensive picture of all the phases mentioned above with the only omission of the item of public health. His omission of the recent progress in public health work was probably due to the fact that this work was started in the metropolitan centers, and is only beginning to reach the rural regions through the establishment of Health Centers in the interior provinces. The task of rural economic reconstruction in a vast country like China is a gigantic one, and the recent achievements in its various phases can hardly be said to have more than a mere humble beginning. Irrigation schemes in Shensi and tho Northwest are now watering millions of mou of farming fields, and the repairing of dikes and dredging of rivers along the Yangtse River are lessening tho dangers of possible recurrences of catastrophic floods such as those of 1931# But these and other similar works barely scratch the surface of the gigantic problem of water control and famine prevention in a country which has the reputation of a Land of Famines and which has to face the tremendous task of irrigating a vast hinterland where annual rainfall is often below 20 inches. It is true that we now have made some progress in crop improvement, agricultural research and education, and the cooperative movement. But the progress already achieved appears so infinitesimally small when compared to the magnitude of the problems involved. What, for instance, is one million members in 26,000 cooperatives in a population of 450 millions? It is also true that, in the realm of reforms in taxation, the provincial and municipal governments have in the last two years abolished 5,200 items of exorbitant and unjust taxes and surcharges. But these are merely insignificant relief measures compared with the untouched fundamental</essay:p>

            <essay:p>problem of land tenure in a country -where 85 per cent of the population is congested on about 17 per cent of the land, and where the boldest stretch of imagination has so far failed to find a formula for an equitable dis&#172; tribution of land which will give the agricultural population a minimum level of decent living. Under the third category may be grouped all the reforms and pro- grosses in the field of education and culture in general. Statistics show that, compared with the first year of the Republic (1912), the number of primary school students has in 1931 increasod four times; that of secondary schools, 8 times; and that of university and college students, 100 times# Beginning with last year, the Ministry of Education is endeavoring to carry out a Five-year ^lan of Compulsory Education by which it aims to give every child of school ago at least one year of free and compulsory education* A second Five-year Plan is to begin in 1940 when the Government hopes to lengthen the period of compulsory education to two years. The success of the first year has given us reason to hope that this very moderate program can be successfully carried out. Of the many educational and cultural changes that arc taking place in China today, I wish to point out a few, the significance of which cannot be easily shown by statistics. One of these is the language problem. In the last twenty years China has successfully solved this problem in two ways. On one hand, the problem of a common language for the whole nation is solved by the recognition of one most universally spoken dialect as the ^ational Language which has since 1921 been used in all primary and secondary schools in the place of the dead classical language. The dialects will srij. [ per&#172; sist, as they all persist in all countries. But the unification in language is achieved v/hon all products of the public schools will be able tc talk and write and understand one another in the National Language, The second phase of the language problem is the creation of a literature in the living national language, ^t is no use to toach the people a language which the best writers and poets refuse to use as their literary medium. The success of the so-called literary renaissance in China lies in the fact that all young writers have accepted this living language of tho people as their medium of prose and poetic composition, and are producing a living literature, the intrinsic worth of which is beginning to be appreciated by the most con&#172; servative elements of the older generation. Another important phase of this &quot;evolutionary process&quot; is tho social evolution which is going on in every aspect of Chinese life. It has been pointed out by some recent observers of Chinese events that thore is much reactionary tendency in the social and cultural movements in China as is evidenced by the revival of the worship of Confucius and by the frequent exaltation of Confucian virtues in the &quot;Now Life Movement&quot; sponsored by im&#172; portant leaders of the Government. As a die-hard advocate of liberalism and modernization, I must confess that such a reactionary tendency does exist and has a following chiefly among party workers and office-seekers. And the explanation is clccir# China is now in the midst of her nationalistic develop&#172; ment, and all nationalistic movements easily lead to an apologetic attitude toward the indigenous civilization of the pact. Moreover, there is no doubt that the reactionary movements in certain quarters of Europe and Asia have had their influence, direct or indirect, over some of the political leaders in China. The tomb and temple of Confucius, for example, were ordered by the Chinese Government to bo repaired and the worship of Confucius was re&#172; vived as a state rite, when China learned that our neighbors in Japan had</essay:p>

The whole movement can be best described as an &quot;evolutionary process parts of which have had their early beginnings two or throe decades ago. This evolutionary process, however, was for a time paralleled and almost inter&#172; rupted by a revolutionary movement best represented by tho Communist Movement which had its origin in the formation of the Chinese Communist Party fifteen yoars ago. The history of the Communist Movement in China is the best illus&#172; tration of the doctrine expounded the other day by our Soviet Russian col&#172; league that Russian Communism is not exportable. Tho early prog,rem oi the Chinese Communist Party which included the 8-hour working day_, vb.j protection of child and woman laborers, tho enforcement of a unified graded com of taxation and the distribution of land to the tillers of the so.&apos;. {. vjos quite moderate and differed very little from the social and poi programs of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. This similarity made it possible for Dr. party to join hand with the Chinese Communist Party for a few years during which the new enthusiasm and discipline of the younger party and the advices ana the organizing ability of the Russian advisors contributed very much to the success of the Nationalist Revolution of 1925-27. When the split finally came in 1927, it was quite clear that, whatever might be the declared dif&#172; ference, the really fundamental incompatibility between the parties was one of procedure; it was evolutionary versus revolutionary methods. The Kuomin- tang was too much inclined toward compromiseing with tho moderate elements of the cities and was at least unconsciously unwilling to risk its political power in an ooen warfare with the foreign powers which they,in thoii acquired terminology, called the Imperialist Powers. The young Communists were im&#172; patient and wanted an immediate revolution which should bo a social and economic revolution, a class war, and a part of tho i/Torld Revolution des&#172; tined to bring about the final overthrow of the capitalistic system. Their impatience led them to all forms of excesses which cost them very much in the loss of sympathy throughout the country. Moreover, the Kuomintang, being rather narrowly nationalistic, was conservative and apologetic for tho old culture of China for which the internationalist Communist had not the least regard. It was these fundamental differences in procedure, in tempo and attitude, which finally led to the tragic split in 1927. After the split, the Chinese Communists, supported by those armies which had been more deeply influenced by their ideas and which later formed the nucleus of the Red Army, have set up an armed opposition to the banking Government and more than once threatened the political stability of the latter. After the successful campaign of the government forces in 1934, they were forced to leave their stronghold in Kiangsi and their remnant forcos moved towards tho southwestern provinces where they were further defeated and scattered.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Judging from their published, appeals for &quot;a United Front&quot; against a common enemy, it is clear that they too have learned from experience the failure of their impatient and revolutionary methods, and arc now putting forward a much more moderate program of mild democratic socialism, &quot;Whether the armed threat of an external enemy will finally bring about the reconciliation and cooperation of the Chinese Communists with the ational Government or not, time alone will tell. But the lesson from this historical episode seems clear. It is that, in the light of history and national teuperament, China, if allowed to pursue hor own course of development, will in all prob&#172; ability follow the path of gradual evolution rather than that of violent revolution,&apos; I now come to the question, Yfhat are the international implications of China*s program of reconstruction? The reconstruction work in all its phases has largely boon carried out by Chinese personnel and financed by Chinese money. But, of course, there arc international implications which may be summed up in these words: from the U,S,A, we get the training of the Chinese personnel; from the League of Nations, the technical advice of experts; from Great Britain, an important portion of the money; and from Japan, all the obstruction. Since the return of the first portion of the Boxer Indemnity to China in 1908 for the purpose of educating Chinese youths in American universities, the U,S,A, for 27 years has been educating Chinese students in scientific technique, technological training and administrative ability. It is these men who form the nucleus of that vast personnel which is planning, loading, directing and executing the- multifarious activities of Chinese reconstruction. The League of ^ations has been very helpful to China in furnishing her with a large number of technical exports whose advicc and assistance have been fcund most useful in the planning of transportation, public health, water control, and rural reform. Of these advisers, mention must bo made of Sir John Hope Simpson whoso great contribution to the relief work during the great floods of the Yangtso region in 1931 will suroly be long remembered in China, The League has recently decided to undertake the training of Chinese technicians by allowing them to be attached to the appropriate sections of the League Secretariat, There has been c omparativoly very little financial aid from the outside in this reconstruction work except the American v/heat and cotton loan which made possible the initial formation of the National Economic Council as the central organ for the direction and planning of many of the projects of reconstruction, and the railway loan from the British banks for the con&#172; struction of the Chiontang River Bridge, But mention must be made of the part played by the British portion of the Boxer Indemnity in the financing of the reconstruction projects. This fund, which had accumulated from the end of 1922 and was returned to China in 1928, has been used in the financing of productive activities,and the Chinese Government guarantees to pay an annual interest of 5 per cent, which interest is again spent on the educational and cultural activities in China, About 7 million pound sterling has been thus used in this reconstructive work. The greatest obstruction to Chinese reconstruction work has come from Japan, from whom wo had a right to expect sympathetic understanding and friendly assistance. This obstruction has come in at least three main directions.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>In &quot;fcho first place, the &quot;whole sorios of events from the sudden invasion and occupation of Manchuria in 1951, and the Shanghai War in 1932, dovm to the invasion of Jehol and the war along the Great Wall in 1933, created a war situation which made it absolutely impossible for the government to pay attention to any constructive work# The invasion of Manchuria took placo at a time when China was faced with the unprecedented catastrophe of the Yangtso floods which affectod 25 million people in 131 hsiens in five provinces, and which resulted in a total material loss of two billion &#8226; The Shanghai War which lasted a little more than a month, caused untold losses in human lives and destruction of property and paralyzed the Yangtso delta for many months during which the Government found it difficult to pay the school teachers and governmental employees* For two whole years, the wholo nation could not settle dovm to do any constructive work. It was not until after the failure of the ^ytton Report and the -^eague of Nations and after the Wars along the Groat Wall that China came to a fuller realization of the significance of the new situation. She now realized that all the peaco machineries of the Pacific region had boon torn to shreds by the armed fist of an aggressive power, and that she had now only herself to rely upon for her own national salvation# China, as it were, was aroused from the slumbers of a false sense of international security# It was not until then that China finally settled down to work on her own program of internal recon&#172; struction# But what a change in the meaning and content of the program I A sense of the imminent danger of national perdition has gripped the whole people,and National Defense has become the generally accepted necessary guiding principle in every thing we undertake# Even the students of the universities and schools arc demanding of their teachers that their educa&#172; tional curriculum be reorganized in order that they may be better prepared to meet the needs of what they call the &quot;extraordinary times i&quot; In the second place, Japan has not only interrupted the peaceful reconstruction work in China, but also openly told the whole world that she does not allow any other nation or nations to render to China any assistance in her reconstruction. In the famous Amau Statement of April 17, 1934, Japan warned the wholo world that, because of her &quot;position and mission&quot; and &quot;special responsibilities in East Asia,&quot; she could not tolerate any joint operations in respect to China &quot;undertaken by foreign powers, even in the name of technical or financial assistance#&quot; In the same Statement, Japan threatened that, in case of her warning being unheeded, whe might be forced to &quot;act alone on her own responsibility#&quot; Indeed, this threat she has tried to carry out more than once# Last November, China promulgated hor new cur&#172; rency reform lav/ which was accepted by all Chinese Banks, and which had the full cooperation of the English and other foreign banks# But Japan, in her anger against China for not having previously informed her, and in her suspicion of British participation and cooperation in the reform schome, began to stir up serious troubles in North China, which, it is commonly be&#172; lieved, wore intended not merely to weaken the authority of the Chinese Government in China, but also to punish the British through the punishing of the Chinese# Lastly, Japan seems to have determined not to tolerate any government that may have a chanco to unify and consolidate Chine.# At least her militar&#172; ists have nevor concealed such intentions# Throughout the whole summer of 1935, Japanese military officers of high rank both in North and South China repeatedly issued statements to the effect that Japan would not deal with the ^anking government as long as General Chiang Kai-shek remained as its powerful leader# In an equally famous Tada Statement of September, 1935,</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 37 STATEMENT FOR SPECIAL PLENARY SESSION CONCERNING SINO-JAPANESE RELATIONS August 25, 1936 (Kenkichi Yoshizawa) It has been suggested that I make a brief statement in order to clarify Japan1s position before further round table discussions of China&apos;s economic re&#172; construction take place. Sino-Japanese friendly relations have a long, historical background, in part due to geographical propinquity and racial affinities. However, since the early years of the Mciji era (beginning 1868), because of intimate relations between the two countries, there have been both agreeable and disagreeable circumstances. Referring to more recent events, we find that unfortunately there have occurred situations which have produced strained conditions. Personally, I deeply regret this situation. I have come to YoSemite with the purpose of ameliorating if possible these unfortunate differences and, further, in the hope that I may contribute toward the re-establishment of our historical, friendly relationship. The Japanese policy toward China should be to maintain friendly relations with her and to promote the smooth progress and prosperity of that great country. This policy has been followed on the whole ever since the conclusion of the first Commercial Treaty in the early part of the Mciji Era. Unfortunately, however, China was torn by civil wars up to 1928 when the country was unified by the Kuo- mintang. When Manchuria, under Chang Hsuoh-Liang, united with the Nanking govern&#172; ment, the unification of China was effected. However, this unification proved to be transitory and again China faced inter-necine struggles and presented the same situation as under the old, military warlords, With the downfall of General Chen of Canton, some two months ago, there was effected a union between C&amp;nton and Nan&#172; king. Thus, it is plain that it was not Japan who obstructed the unification and reconstruction of China, but it was rather the internecine struggles which in real&#172; ity constituted the fundamental obstacle. &quot;Fifteen years ago, at the suggestion of the United States, a conference was convoked at Washington, to which interested nations came, and Japan joined with them to promote the peace and prosperity of China. To substantiate this statement, I may*mention the signing of the Nine Power Treaty and the various concessions made to China to ameliorate her tariff situation, as well as the restoration of Shantung to China. &quot;Soon after the Washington Conference, a tariff conference was convoked in Peiping and Japan led in the movement to restore tariff autonomy to China. But due to internal disturbances, this restoration had not been carried out until 1929, when it was actually effected. In spite of Japan&apos;s friendly attitude, China im&#172; mediately raised her tariffs, which raise has most adversely affected Japan&apos;s trade with China. And this action not only damaged Japan&apos;s interests, but also adversely affected the well-being of the common people of China, because these Japanese goods net the ovoifday nco ds of the masses, &quot;In addition, ^hina has again and again violated her treaty obligations towards Japans For instance, in spite of the Protocol of December 22, 1905, pro&#172; hibiting Chinese construction of railways parallel to the South Manchuria rail&#172; way, and in spite of repeated protests by the Japanese Government against this action on the part of China, the latter actually did construct such railways.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>&quot;Our attitude of conciliation at that time towards China, instead of meeting with a reciprocal attitude on the part of the latter, met rather with a policy of greater and continued violence on the part of the Chinese. This led to the Manchurian incident of September 18, 1951. &quot;The anti-Japanese movement in China proper, namely: South, Central, and North China, continued unabated and even increased to an intolerable extent. Consequently, Japanese lives and property, shipping and commerce, suffered tremendously. Ve in Japan, have thousands of Chinese residents. The friendly attitude of the Japanese people is abundantly explained by the fact that the Chinese residents liv&#172; ing in Japan have never been molested in any way when anti-Japanese movements of the worst type have been going en in China. &quot;As I see the situation in retrospect, 1 do not feel that everything Japan did in the past was right, but I am equally convinced that what China did was not always correct. Therefore, the differences and ill-feeling which exist at the present between the two countries can only be remedied by the assumption of a more conciliatory attitude on both sides for a considerable period of time. Unfortunately, in such international convocations as the Peace Conference in Paris and the Tfashington Conference, we have been made a subject for vituperation, I feel that the best way to bring about the desired harmonious relations is for China to change this attitude and to cooperate with Japan, Yfhile I have spoken candidly in order to make my position clear, I had no in&#172; tention to make any of my remarks deliberately offensive to my Chinese colleagues and their well-wishers. My solo conviction is that the only way to attain peace and stability in that country is for all of us courageously to face the stark realities.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 26 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON CHINESE RECONSTRUCTION, AUGUST 25, 1936 (Dr. P,C. Chang) Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: We have just spent two days in discussing the phenomenon and certain im&#172; plications of the reconstruction movement in China that has attracted inter&#172; national attention in recent years. It is but natural that only a few phases have been touched upon during the limit of time. I think at the conclusion of this discussion it may be well for us to turn our attention to a little wider view of the whole movement. The word reconstruction itself requires some modification, &quot;what is after all taking place in China today Is what we might say is the more intensive ex&#172; pression, more articulate expression of a larger movement of Chinese adjustment in the modern world, that, due to size, to hugeness of the population, to long drawn conditions, has been slower than many of us wished, but it is a fact that the slowness of that development has necessitated fundamental questioning, and we hope as a result of the fundamental questioning tho final result, or rather the final way may be more satisfactory, more stable, more fittingly modern than the way of adjustment that can be described as ill-digested and only bringing temporary advantage. However, that last sentence requires some explanation, What aro somo of the fundamental questions that hove been raised? Why is it that people in China today aro still discussing such problems as whether China is going through a period of complcto Westernization or whether China should still keep certain of tho traditional ways of doing things. That is still considered a problem in Chinese discussion. It may strike you as being a little theoretical and yet it seems to be necessary. Why is it so and how is it so? After tho period of the conception of conflict there is the conception that either Chinese traditional ways will remain or western ways must be adopted. After the period of conflict, comes the period of compromise, the compromise may be stated in such words, that is, to take on what is good from other cultures and to keep what is good in your own. That is usually taken to bo the liberal view - to take on what is good from other cultures and to keep what is good in your own. But nevertheless that still leaves two questions to bo answered: What is good? How to determine tho good? And secondly, what is the nature of the procoss of taking on and keeping in the field of cultural activities, I mil, may I, repeat those two questions. I think they arc fundamental. (l) What is the good? How to determine tho good? (2) What is tho nature of the process of taking on or keeping tho activities in the cultural field? We may then follow that discussion a little further and sec what thoughts are going through the Chinese mind, for after all, in these various expressions of activities in road building, in political organization, in educational adjustment in those various things, we are simply following out certain of tho hesitancies as</essay:p>

            <essay:p>woll as certain of the gropings of the adjustment to this modern world, looking from a &quot;broad point of view, Now, how to determine the good? One man nay say you need a bath-tub; another man may say you need certain ways of doing things. Certain terminology I think when applied to the Chinese case always requires a new definition. Using words that are common in general western parlance, we have to be extremely careful when applied to words in the Chinese case. Is the Chinese situation simply a process of westernization, what is usually called - total westernization? I think you can not find any Chinese conscious of the modern world who still maintains old ways must still be kept. You may find occasionally in China as elsewhere a certain trend of opinion that takes pride in the old things as a sort of inferiority complex, as a sort of assertion of something within themselves as a matter of hurt pride, so to speak, but nevertheless the general trend has gone far beyond that narrow point of view, that protective conservatism. Protective conservatism is unworthy and I am happy to say the majority of the people in China who think have given that up. The next question, what is the nature of the process that China is going through? Is it a process of westernization? So often we use that term. If we push that a little further wo will find there are difficulties in that conception. In other words, what do you mean by westernization? &apos;&quot;&apos;hat do you moan by the west? Historically there have been many xvests and geographically I am sure today we find many wests. Shall wo westernize according to the fascist model or communist model? 1&apos;hey are all western products. If you call it western, which period of western history shall we copy most? Some people have suggested the word &quot;modernization.&quot; They tell us that about 150 years ago China was not far behind the rest of the countries of the world in material things. One hundred or 150 years ago the Chinese economic condition, although differently organized, nevertheless could supply certain comforts that were rather surprising, to say the least. They were as comfortable in China - even more so - than in Europe 200 years ago; the various utensils used 200 years ago; the various utensils Europeans used 200 years ago. Two hundred years ago Chinese civilization as a whole did not particularly emphasize what wo might call today spiritualistic oast. &apos;-&apos;Ie have always paid attention to the material things of life. I have no time now to mention those things. As a matter of fact if you read some of the early reports of the Jesuit missionaries you will find that Semi do, a Portuguese priest, went to China and re&#172; ported things in China wore more comfortable - better clothes, better houses, and oven the prisons v&lt;rere more comfortable. In other words, comparing tho material phases of life two hundred years ago, China was not far behind. The Chinese wore able to live fairly comfortably. Of course today if you go to China you will say they are barbarians be&#172; cause they haven&apos;t bath-tubs. Marco Polo was surprised at the way tho Chinese took baths. Isn&apos;t that curious? Baths arc quite a modern i lea and the daily bath that is considered to be good manners is still proverbial, I am afraid. Thus to people who see that historical perspective - 200 years ago China was not far behind the rest of tho world in material things - what China needs is simply to modernize. But after all that concept is not satisfactory because you cannot understand the modern world without its historical background, without its Greek heritage and Hebrew traditions of onoTs self being right and nobor^ else right. That sort of tradition, the Hebraic, GodTs chosen people and that sort of thing, ordinarily has contributed to modern nationalism.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Now you can&apos;t understand the modern world without the &quot;background* Con&#172; sequently China to modernize will have to understand certain things of Greek times, We are trying to establish a system of modern law. How can we without Roman law? A modern system of scientific investigation. How can we without the Greek dialectic? Historically there have been many wests and today geographically there have beqn many wests. Then what is the process that China is going through? It is not westernization nor modernization, I think that is the most important thing behind it all, I hope we will raise our heads about this presentation of the present period and see the transition of one-fifth of the modern race - what effect it is going to have on that amount of people and what that amount of people will finally produce and how that will affect the world, What is the nature of the process? After all what is required in China is a different kind of adjustment and I hope that this point will be made clear, thct our slowness, its own difficulties, has brought sufferings to usj that I hope the sufferings will result in a deeper questioning so that when the adjustment comes it will be more final and not the ill-digested type of adjustment. It will be more fittingly modern and stable, VJhat does that mean? It moans that we will have to face the situation more critically than we have done and people have ever done, Iiow will we make that adjustment to the modern world. It is not exclusively modern. It is not narrowly a westernization. Then what is it? That is the key to the situation, I think we can see evidences in China today especially, and getting seme of those evidences before us, we may be able to extract from those evidences cer&#172; tain tendencies, I will formulate those tendencies in three phrases - the tend&#172; encies that may characterize this Chinese way of adjustment to the modern world - this is not yet absolutely recognized but many of you will see tendencies through all the hesitancies, through call the maladjustment - tendencies of ways of doing t hing s, The first phrase we might say is a sensitive recognition of concrete dissatisfactions - sensitive recognition of the fringe of concrete dissatisfactions. By that is meant not simply vague things - fantastic things. For the first gener&#172; ation of our adjustment; wo might soy the conception was rather vague but now I think it is becoming more concrete. Looking at the dissatisfactions as they arc you find the university professors talking in that woyj you will find the students are all going into the problems. Concrete dissatisfactions - what they are, not only as a whole but also the fringe. What do I mean by the fringe? That narrow lino, that wavering line -where the situation as it is gives that sense of the broken fringo of dis&#172; satisfaction, The mind must be keen enough to have that sensitive recognition of the fringe of concrete dissatisfaction* You find the Chinese today, especially in the last three or four years, dissatisfied with anybody talking in big words, &quot;What are you driving at? How can we get at it? I seem to discern the development in this delegation - challenging the people who use big terras and asking, &quot;Do you sensitively rocognize the fringe of that dissatisfaction?&quot;</essay:p>

            <essay:p>(2) We might say an extensive survey for stimulation and suggestion - not exclusively from any system; not exclusively from any geographical tradition; not exclusively from any definite part in history^ either Chinese or western, but an extensive survey for order, for stimulation and suggestion in facing the present. And it is in that direction that Chinese are now, I think, understanding the modern world a little better than the generation before us, I think we are gradually seeing things as to how they have come into being. We are gradually learning your history and reinterpreting our own history; (3) What I might call a liberated inventiveness. That implies whatever suggestion you may see in formulated ways of doing things in other parts of the world or other times in history you must see them in terras of their own condition&#172; ing circumstances. Thereby you acquire an inventiveness. You must pardon me for hurrying because my time is limited and a- subject like this should be discussed in more leisurely mood. Summing up: (l) A sensitiveness of the fringe of the dissatisfaction, not only with the conditions but also dissatisfaction in western terms; among the thinkers in China today a dissatisfaction with the conditions and trying to as&#172; certain the broken edges of dissatisfactions; and (2) An extensive survey. Some of the students who have never been abroad now surprise me. I feel my generation who have had the privilege of travelling abroad are gradually losing our prestige, I think those of us who have taught in China understand the modern world better than those who have spent five or six years abroad. A student of mine writes Chinese, English, French, German and Russiai In other words, there are people in the younger generation who are able to see things in a more concrete wtty than my generation, probably the first that wont abroad in an extensive manner. Up to the end of the 19th century the Chinese were stupid enough to believe they were self-sufficient. It is only with the turning of the century that the Chinese went abroad to study. Only after thirty years certain minds have been produced in China who can see things more clearly than those of us who have wasted time and money abroad. There Is this tendency in China of finding out the details of the situ&#172; ation in a much more concrete manner. I do see a tendency in this direction, no longer using words for the sense of general satisfaction calling a man a petty bourgeois and saying ho is no good. That is gradually lessening and getting more concrete. So this adjustment of China to the modern world, looked at broadly, is one of the most significant things in the world today and we hope that out of this will come a stable adjustment,a digested adjustment, a fittingly modern ad&#172; justment of China to the modern world, and we hope that certain things may come forth that may serve as humble suggestions to the rest of the world as well. Now we turn to the present. Evidently the essential temper that is easily noticeable to recent visitors in China is a realization of the need of integration of notional effort. That integration is implied in the desire for what we might call self-direction and national independence. To find a way out in our own manner. We think that we may be pardoned for asserting thct we may perhaps be allowed a little self-direction. That integration is applied in the self-direction and national independence as the first and foremost consideration,</essay:p>

            <essay:p>le-wing social policies to bo adjusted as occasions arise, That has already been commented upon. One may wonder, in hearing the discussions of the last two days&apos; round tables why so much time has boon spent on the question of Japan in relation to China,s reconstruction. Curious, isn&apos;t it? Obviously China&apos;s reconstruction is a Chinese problem, and the fact that so much attention has been given to relation&#172; ship of the different activities of Japan to china&apos;s reconstruction is a reflection that those activities are, justly or unjustly, taken not only by Chinese but by the whole world as having had some direct adverse effcct on Chinese reconstruction. We must make it dear not only to our Japanese friends but to the world at large that we admire what our neighbors have dono in the last half century despite certain serious problems awaiting solution. Those efforts have been heroic, We sincerely admire than. Please take that as really sincere, Lay I soy wo have a great deal to learn from them. The traditional friendship of the two people in Eastern Asia is a fundamental fact that cannot be denied, But the difficulties in the way must somehow be removed and we still hope that somehow such difficulties will bo removed in a peaceful way, Trte have hoard it stated that our neighbors have always had a good will toward us. We appreciate that expression but somehow it seems to leave the im&#172; pression - to state it frankly - that the present misunderstanding has been duo to either Chinese stupidity or ^hinesc ingratitude. Yet occasionally we find state&#172; ments emanating from Japanese sources, and those statements have given the Chinese occasion to suspect - not necessarily justified, at least occasion to suspect that the ways to bring about that good will are rather difficult to understand. May I be pardoned for reading you a short paragraph from a sto.toment issued on September 1, 1935 by General Tada, the Commander of the Japanese Military Garrison in Tiontsi: This statement was denied later but nevertheless was made by a Japanese officor, so porhaps it may be very interesting. The statement is called &quot;The Fun amental Concept of Japanese Policy Toward China,&quot; I am sure many of my Japanese friends deny the authenticity of that state&#172; ment. Copies were distributed to the educational institutions in Peking and Tients: by the Japanese Garrison, At first we didn&apos;t dare to open the pamphlets and finally we opened them and found beautifully printed copies of the statement. And we road this - from Cho.ptor 3, Section 6: &quot;To take advantage of the greediness and lack of loyalty of the Chinese militarists and to induce them to offer us special privileges in order to facilitate our economic development or to supply such militarists with money and munitions in order to buy their services; Such is the old formula of our policy, and must be regarded as against the principle of openness which should characterize the Empire&apos;s policy. For instance, in North China the Empire&apos;s garrison has already acquired in fact the power of direct control and there is no more necessity of making uso of Chinese militarists,&quot; That is a very interesting statement. It may be denied but it was officially issued. However, it is not my iesirc to leave you with this point of contention. Old scores must be forgotten if we want to find a now trail toward pea.ee. Lot bygones be bygones, &apos;When things cannot be explained, I think it is advisable not to try to explain them. Facts must be faced and among them is the firm and growing confidence of the Chinese people already alluded to to solve their own problems on the basis of self&#8212;direction and self&#8212;reliance. This is not a, denial of assistance; neither should this be used by anyone as a claim for monopolistic control in China,</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 25 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON CHINESE RECONSTRUCTION, AUGUST 25, 1936. (Lord Snell) We have now reached a point in the work of this Congress when we pass from detailed plans and acts of special governments to general principles and outlooks to try to discover how these separate acts will react upon the world at large. In our searching discussions there has been no scapegoat; no nation has escaped being questioned; none has evaded an answer. The United States, Japan, Russia, China have all been separately examined and even my own inexperienced and guileless country has not been forgotten in our inquiries. What then up to date have we achieved? World peace? No, But we have wished to achieve it, which is the first fruitful step in that direction. Have we achieved knowledge and understanding of each other? To some extent we have, above all else, been able to look the other fellow in the face and to call him friend. Now, in this concluding speech tonight I want to be as brief as possible for during the last ten days such an avalanche of words has fallen in this Valley such as these ancient walls have never heard before, I think I understand now the wisdom of that school boy in my own native land who said that in America they put their criminals to death by elocution, and also in my own country, especially at this time of night, the kind of oratory wo like best is finished oratory. But we have to try to understand what yet remains for us to do, I believe that we have in essentials a three-fold task. The first is: How to encourage and advise Japan in the peaceful expansion which she desires and which we wish that she should have - how this alert, this valiant little nation can fulfill her own destiny without so injuring the process of the world as to create disaster. For her the immediate position is this: that If the other nations were to erect Impassable barriers against her the Japanese people would starve, and Japan quite rightly has no intention that they should starve. Our second problem is how in a rapidly changing world wo can prevent China from becoming broken China- how wo can assist this old distressed land to reorganize her own life and to restore something of her old glories. Those of us who belong to the western modern nations owe her a great deal. Those of us who were privileged in London this year to witness her wonderful exhibition of art could do no more than enter into a kind of silent homage for all that she stood for - the serenity and power and restfulness that seemed so refreshing to this troubled world. And today we know that she has difficult troubles. There is another debt we owe her, 1 understand that it was she who invented coinage. In that respect I have a personal grievance against her that she didn&apos;t invent enough of it in those sections of life that I know best. But today we see l\er developing her energies; coordinating her great strength, determined to defend and develop at all costs her own cultural and intellectual values.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>And thirdly, wo have to try to decide how the western world can face this now impact upon its life. The difficulty is that the eastern nations entered into the western industrial system at a dangerously low lovely a level that wo had long left behind us, a level that if it were successful, would reduce our general standards. Now, as the economists know from the Gresham law of coinage, if two coins arc in circulation in one area, one a &quot;bad coin and the other a good one, the bad one will tend to drive the good coin out of circulation* When a lower standard of life compotes with a higher one, the tendency is for the low standard to make headway and for the higher standard to become submerged. Some authorities hold that that was the reason why Rome declined; that invasions of peoples with lower standards reduced her standards until she became weak and incapable. That is our position in the west. We shall defend our standards of life because we must de&#172; fend them, but that is not incompatible with the possibilities of cooperation with the eastern nations and the development of higher standards for their own. people. Over-production that we so often hear about is just a capitalistic myth. There is no such thing. The wants of the world are insatiable. If we can break down, the barriers which prevent the free flow of goods and services the delusion of over-production can be put to one side. It is to find a solution to these problems that the remainder of our conference must be devoted. That is first of all the problem of raw materials. I believe the whole of my delegation believes that there can bo no permanent Jsoaco in the world that is not based upon social justice and some measure of equality or equity between one people and another. We are asked in our agenda for tomorrow to consider the question of collective security in the Pacific,, &quot;fell, that is the problem of the whole world, and it is no more difficult in the Pacific area than anywhere else, but it is so important that wo should find a way to collective security that it is becoming a race between common sanity and disaster. We are asked whether such machinery as is necessary should be organized under the League of Nations or under special regional pacts. I don&apos;t mind which - eithor or both, if it will give us peace, that will be abiding in our time. When I go to church I don&apos;t mind who plays the organ if I like the tune that is being played. But I personally believe that the best way is the League of Nations. We have the League. It is with us. And one hair on the head is worth two in the brush&#169; You know I always adnirod that Church of England clergyman who preached a sermon upholding the doctrines of his church and when he&apos;was questioned by an American visitor - the ijincrican visitor said to him: &quot;Say, do you really mean to say that there is no other way to Heaven except through the Church of England?&quot; And the parson said, &quot;Well, it is possible there may be another way but no gentle&#172; man would ever think of taking advantage of it&#174;&quot; There may be other ways than the League of Nations. I dare not continue. But lot me say this, that in life we build upon experience. To uproot is to destroy, but to graft on to the old trunk is to give now and fruitful life. Now the problem of the 20th century as I sec it Is just this: how the different races of men may live upon the earth in peace and in harmony. And that is the problem to which we are devoting our attention in these wonderful lays of our experience. Wo are facing the problem with an earnest desire to solve it and the</essay:p>

            <essay:p>price of succcss is nothing less than tho salvation of mankind. Tiliat we dosiro will not be achieved by arguments or by polite dissembling&#174; Vie have to ask each other definite questions and try to get the real problem firmly in our minds. The old way has been tried throughout history and has failed. &quot;Some therefore cried one, some another and the more part knew not wherefore they were called together, but all cried, groat is Diana of the Ephesians.&quot; We have cried peace when there was no peace but we have not cried dismay before the task which confronts us. Wo knew the importance; v&lt;re know the magnitude; but we take courage in our belief that we can solve it. Let us look at one aspect of the problem which confronts us. There is no sense in hiding the fact that the world is drifting towards a new irrationalism. We are governed by mass phobias which are encouraged and preached as policies of national regeneration and tho new humanism. The new intellectualism has to face a new barbarism &apos;which may be more destructive than any that the world has known. The metaphysicians and tho physicists, such as our distinguished colleague, Professor Millikan, assure us that the past is past and the Almighty himself can not alter the past. But what God cannot do the politically minded historian and the war fostering politician both can and does day by day. Wo have the doctorod press; we have the tainted sermon; we have the poisoned broadcast and the warped education, end the world considers not its own limitations but devlops a disease of national and racial self-adoration. The power complex is increasingly fostered in us and we are taught to hold in contempt the lesser breeds without the law, which includes all those who do not belong to the best clubs. More and more we are becoming alike. Our minds arc being cut to a pattern which is too often a pattern desired by a government or a class or a special interest. I want diversity and unity through diversity. The attraction of a picture gallery does not consist in its uniformity but its variety. Rubens differs from Rembrandt, and Michael Angelo from Raphael, and that is what entrances us. The flowers and the trees differ in color and size and texture but all are necessary to make up the landscape and the beauty of the earth on which wo dwell. And so I believe that every race has its own special contribution to make to the v/orld whi ch the world cannot do without. A nation shuts itself within its walls by tariff barriers and yet it can&#172; not be isolated. Emerson told us we are piqued with pride of pure descent but nature loves innoculation. And so in this groat problem we are considering 1 want, to repeat, unity through diversity. Let each nation bring its gifts to the common pool. Didn&apos;t Robert Bridges give us that thought: &quot;Each to the world&apos;s right market brings Its bright, divine imaginings In rival tribute to surprise The world with native merchandize.&quot; And so I believe we shall have to return to our old gods, not our new ones; to democracy rather than dictatorship. I know how slow progress is under democracy and how depressing the speed sometimes is. I believe that if Moses had had to consult a committee before he went across the Rod Sea ho would have been overtaken by Pharoah&apos;s hosts and exterminated. I have never known a committee that was any good except wheal I was the only member of it. But that is the price we pay for democracy. It is the one gospel and social mechanism which</essay:p>

            <essay:p>transforms o. population into a people. It is the only system under which you can&#172; not loaf -without personal dishonesty. Now I must not detain you further except to express my belief that there is a &quot;better way than war and that we shall find it. You will forgive me if I refer to my own. country again - just a little loyal patriotism in passing - but in the old days in London the old craft guilds, as you have known them, were always quarrelling - fighting against each other, and the two most irreconcilable companies were the ancient company of the master tailors and the skinners, and they were brought to trial and the Lord Mayor of that period - Lord Mayor Billesden on the 10th of April, 1484 - I hope I have got the date right - passed a judgment and he condemned them that each yjar the master tailors were to invite the master company of skinners to their ^ity Hall and give them the best dinner they could, and he also condemned the other side to invite their opponents in the same way and once a year for 452 years these old enemies meet together in one of the wonderful ^ity Halls and dine together. Now it is a part of my duty in London to attend those ceremonies and I assure you that the dinner is thoroughly worth while going to. And so I think there is a bettor way, I think we shall find it, I am not one of those who dispair because I think I see that the prophets of woo of the past have been wrong, &quot;It is a gloomy moment in history. Not for many years ~ not in the lifetime of most men who read this paper - has there boon sn much grave end deep apprehension; never has the future seemed so incalculable as at this time. In our own country there is universal commercial prostration and panic, and thousands of our poorest fellow-citizens are turned out against the approaching winter without employment and without the prospect of it. In France the political caldron seethes and bubbles with uncertainty; Russia hangs, as usual, like a cloud, dark and silent, upon the .horizon of Europe; while all the energies, resources and influences of the British Empire are sorely tried, and are yet to be tried more sorely, in coping with the vast and deadly Indian insurrection, and with its disturbed relations in China,&quot; That inspired message appeared in Harpersfs YJcokly on the 10th day of October 1857 - 79 years ago, after which Anerica had one of the most wonderful periods of prosperity that any country ever saw. But she wasnft alono in that. My own country had its similar profits, ^ilberforce in the 19th century said: &quot;I dare not marry, the future is so dark and unsettled,&quot; The Duke of Wellington in 1851 thanked God he would be espared from seeing the consummation of ruin that was gathering around him; and Lord Shaftesbury in 1868 declared nothing could save the British Empire from shipwreck. It didn,t happen, and so today I am one of those who Is going to keep his faith. Dead walls are constantly being broken down and every day new tools are being invented to our use.</essay:p>

Do we aot owe part of our civilization to the social and cultural heredity which comcs to us through many nations? Rome was tho daughter of Greece and all have learned from each. In a day or two we shall separate and our minds will be richer through this cross fertilization that has taken place among us. Vfe have tried to make our contribution to the greatest problem of our time. Lot us carry tho spirit of these gatherings to our own separate lands and try to interpret it to our own people. Then if we succeed in preserving the peace our labors will have been blessed indeed but if our efforts fail and the nations are again at war, there will nevertheless be peace in us.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 15 REPORT OF THIS GENERAL RAPPORTEUR ON ROUND TABLE TOPIC IV CHINA Ladies and Gentlemen: Vie spent last week in the consideration of the policies of the United States, the U.S,S#R#J and Japan as they hear on the international relations of the Pacific Area. While we devoted a good deal of time to the domestic situations in those countries out of which their foreign policies arise and to the general, world-wide effects of those policies, our thoughts were never far from the re&#172; lations of these policies to the situation in China, We began our discussions of China, itself, therefore, with a good deal of thought engendered in the previou round tables and with the conspicuous advantage of having had some time to scrutin ize the very valuable documents prepared on this subject by our councils in China, Japan and the United Kingdom. It was accordingly possible for us to concentrate into six hours of discussion an extraordinary amount of comment directly pertinent to our agenda and it was possible to progress steadily towards a general consensus of opinion which furnishes an admirable starting point for the construction of our final topic, &quot;The Changing Balance of Forces in the Pacific and the Possibil&#172; ities of Peaceful Change.&quot; I shall report our discussions under the three headings of our agenda, but before doing this I should like to mention the characteristics of these dis&#172; cussions which most impressed me and which may serve to focus my ensuing remark:*?. First, I was impressed by the extraordinary record of reconstruction in China to which all observers, from no matter what nation, testified. This reconstruction is progressing along all lines, economic, social and political and follows or inheres in, as one Chinese member put it, a conspicuous change in the mental attitude of the Chinese masses towards the institution of government itself and towards innovations. But this reconstruction is conditioned or obstructed by two factors, one, dissatisfaction from considerable sections of the Chinese popu&#172; lation -with the capitalist or bourgeois aspects of the reconstruction methods and auspices, the other, the disrupting influence of Japanese aggression. My second impression was the conspicuous absence of hostile statements regarding the present program of the Chinese Communist movement from our Chinese members and the very fair and objective way in which they described its history and program. This left me with the thought that the way might still be open for complete Chinese unity including the Communists either in an emergency national defence government or in a constitutional democracy following the adoption of a constitution this coming fall. The third impression is one which must have struck all of you forcibly, namely, the determination of China to take care of herself and to preserve her entity as a great nation vis-a-vis Japanese aggression.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>To turn now to the formal part of my report, I shall first take up item I on the agenda, &quot;Chinese Reconstructiont Aims and Achievements,&quot; Here we begin by a consideration of the physical reconstruction which it was generally agreed was the prerequisite of political unity. Our data papers contained such full in&#172; formation on this question that in our meetings we did not undertake any rounded recapitulation of the reconstruction program. We did, however, lay emphasis on the vast increase in trunk highways which are rapidly shortening the distances among all the provinces of China and we noted that the length of these highways had increased phenomenally in the last few years - from 1,000 kilometres in 1921 to 100,000 kilometres in 1936, The great value of this program was generally ap&#172; preciated by all members of the Conference and the question relating to it had to do with relatively minor points. The Chinese were asked if it were not true that the highways were primarily for military purposes and to the farmer of small economic value if not indeed an economic hardship because the farmers had to build the roads themselves under a system of forced labor. The reply was that these points were partly true, but i/fiat there were extenuating circumstances: the lack cf capital made resort to forced labor a necessity; the military nature of the roads was a temporary feature required by the circumstances. Mention was made of the other features of the reconstruction program in the fields of finance, railways, agriculture and land holding, public health, and in social and cultural measures. In regard to the entire reconstruction pro&#172; gram an American member asked who were the principal beneficaries, the bankers and industrialists or the farmers. A Chinese member replied that the answer de&#172; pended on tho point of view taken, whether judgr.iont was based on the concrete facts of the moment or on the historical relation of what was being done now to what was done in the past. The Chinese situation can bo observed from the longer view of unification first and then development of the larger social measures second, or it can be looked at from the point of view of the common people. From the long view progress on behalf of the common people is more apparent than from the short view. To illustrate this point the Chinese member said that the new cooperatives organized by the modern banks loaned money to farmers at 12 to 15% whereas the old interest charges were much more exorbitant, in other words that while the modern practice was not above criticism, it showed marked progress over the old. It should of course bo noted, and the ^hinese were the first to admit this, that in comparison to the needs of the country the whole reconstruction program was still inadequate. Much emphasis was put on China1s need of foreign capital to finance her reconstruction program, the Chinese and foreign members being agreed on this point. Three difficulties in the way of securing such capital were pointed out, the least important of which because of its probable temporary character being the unwilling&#172; ness of American and British bankers during recent years to send money to China. Statements were made at the round tables that this situation might soon be remedied. The second difficulty was the terms on which China was willing to borrow, terms which a number of the foreigners questioned as possibly providing unsatisfactory security but to which tho Chinese strenuously clung because of their previous dis&#172; astrous experience with political and foreign-supervised loans from the imperialist powers and because of what the Chinese pointed out as being a remarkable improve&#172; ment in the integrity and efficiency of their own government.

As the elaboration of this point came in the discussion of Sino-Japanese relations I shall now do no more than thus mention the item. So much, and it is too little, for the first heading in our agenda. Aiming to &quot;The Communist Movement in China&quot; our second heading, there was con&#172; siderable discussion of the differences between Nanking&apos;s program of reconstruction and that offered by the Communists. With respect to internal economic and social questions a direct comparison was sought in Kiangsi Province occupied by the government when it was ovacuated by the Communists in 1934 after almost six years of administrative control. It was pointed out that the Communist regime had brought about rural reforms in dispossessing large landowners and redistributing the land among the peasantry, creating cooperatives in place of the old usurious money-lenders and unorganized forms of production and marketing, establishing a more adeciuate educational system, and greatly improving trie position of women. Upon taking ovor the province, the government had given back the land to tho land&#172; lords except that a limit of 100 mow or about 17~o~ acres was placed on an individual holding and the surplus land turned over to cooperatives. While the government thus partially preserved certain reforms or introduced new ones, the discussions clearly indicated that the Nanking policy of rural rehabilitation is frankly a capitalist one as contrasted to a Communist one. A comparison on the basis of Kiangsi Province, however, is already out of date, for as a Chinese member pointed out, in the right of a changing scene the Chinese Communists have modified their program. They have given up the con&#172; fiscation of land, they have abandoned the policy of confiscating foreign property except that belonging to Japanese, arid they have signified their desire to co&#172; operate fully with other political groups within China in a united effort against Japanese imperialism. A more fruitful basis for comparing the program of Nanking and the Communists seemed to lie in their respective foreign policies. On this point it was indicated that if the Communist program be taken at face value it differed from Nanking&apos;s only in being openly and aggressively anti-Japanese, but it was also suggested that this similarity might be only a superficial one in that the fundamental Communist position was over a long period irreconcilable with Nanking&apos;s capitalist tendencies. On the actual strength and significance of the Communist movement there were marked differences of opinion expressed, one Chinese expressing the view that they were no longer an important internal factor, and a foreigner the view that they wore stronger today than at any time since 1927. One Chinese member gave his views on the subject at length and width with great clarity. He felt that if viewed as an organized political movement the Communists had been broken late in 1934 on. the evacuation of Kiangsi and Fukien and were now not an important</essay:p>

An .American member expressed tho opinion that Chinese Communism in tho last three years had changed its manifestations in adapting its program to Chinese conditions and to Japanese imperialism. He felt there was no indication that tho movement was spent. On the contrary, he believed the Chinese masses wore becoming increasingly aware of the fact that their bourgeois leaders were not acting solely in the country&apos;s interests, but also in their own capitalist interests. He felt, too, that many Chinese were dissatisfied with tho government&apos;s non-resistance to the Japanese on the ground that a policy of waiting was more advantageous to Japan than to China, He also suggested that during tho period of waiting other foreign powers might gain a hold on China which they might use to their own ad&#172; vantage at a later period0 He suggested further that if Japon could bo viewed as the sole bulwark against tho spread of Communism in Asia so Chinese Communism could be viewed as the principal bulwark against the spread of Japanese imperialism. As the foregoing parts of this report have indicated, or at least implied, there was widespread feeling in tho round tables that Japanese aggression had strengthened tho position of the Chinese Communist movement. One member stressed this point rather clearly when he suggested that Japanese aggression was making Communists good Chinese citizens. In view of the prominence given to the sup&#172; pression of this movement by the Japanese Foreign Minister&apos;s demands on the Nanking Government, our discussions passed easily to tho third division of our agenda, namely, &quot;International Implications of Chinese Reconstruction,&quot; The transition to this topic had also been made in the earlier discussion regarding China&apos;s urgent need of foreign capital and assistance. It is from this latter point that I may more suitably begin. You vd.ll recall that one of the chief obstacles to foreign assistance in Chinese reconstruction was thought to be the Japanese policy as enforced in April 1934 by Mr, Am.au, spokesman of the Japanese Foreign Office, The round tables conscientiously sought to determine the exact meaning of the Ajnau Doctrine, as subsequently modified by the Foreign Office, in its application to the question of foreign assistance to China. Japanese members stressed the point that the Amau statement had received serious criticism in Japan as woll as abroad and had accordingly been significantly modified, I am not certain that the Japanese position on this question was really clarified in our discussion, for while It was stated that Japan desired to pre&#172; serve the Open Ibor in China, that benefits to hina were- more often than not also benefits to Japan, and that Japan&apos;s policy did not exclude foreign assistance to China of a non-political and non-military nature, nevertheless it was evident that Japan wished to reserve some sort of right of consultation or even power of veto. The exact nature of that right or of that power was not discovered in our discussions. Perhaps the most accurate general report on this point that I can make is that Japan wishes China to consult her on any matters pertaining to foreign assistance and that presumably such a right would carry with it the power of veto.</essay:p>

Before such discussion can be of value, I suggest some clarification of terms is essential. And I propose to make some remarks upon cer&#172; tain conceptions that are used in the discussion scheme. The main terms I will consider will be change, peaceful change, collective security and collective systems. This scheme makes one admission that is crucial and which very many discussions ig&#172; nore and that is that the main problem of the Pacific as in other parts of the world is change and the adjustment to change. Somehow or other over the whole world the tempo of change has been rapidly increased so that the difficulties of adjustment are almost insuperable. I think it is exceedingly important to recognize that changes of this kind are the most important causes of international difficulty. Policy under changing conditions is difficult and nervous changes occur in which old economic structures are unsuitable and machinery which sustained large popu&#172; lations becomes inadequate. These populations struggle to maintain their old position though it rapidly bccomes impossible. The phenomenon of rapid change is the most vital feature of the post-war world and the underlying cause of all our difficulties. The war created a tempo of changes which had been inevitable for many years but which would have gone on in the revolutionary way. The changes which are occurring are inevitable. It would be as futile to stop them as to brush back the waves of the sea. They are to an extent involuntary and uncontrollable and all we can do is to accomodate ourselves to them. Vie must make these accomodations peacefully, but the term peaceful change often assumes that the changes necessary are relatively simple. The idea is that some expert knows them and we have only to follow his advice. This is net true. The changes in the social structure of the nature of which we have been considering have some analogy to change in physical structure. Strains accumulate and breaks occur. But they are still less control&#172; lable than physical changes because they are the product or resultant of the activ&#172; ities of millions of human beings, produced by separate will, and influenced by emotions and ideas which must work thru these individual minds. The fallacy of an easily controllable world must be abandoned. Peaceful change, therefore, is not a matter of prescription by an export or the decision of a democratic body or the rescript of a dictator - it must result from changes in human conduct on the part of large masses. The position, therefore is that change is happening at an un&#172; usual rate in the world around us. YTe cannot stop it or wholly control it. YJhat we have to do is to make the adjustments that are necessary without war. The doctrine of collective security raises the question whether the desire for security is compatible with the necessity for change. Collective security is axiom&#172; atic. Somebody is this series ef discussions will perhaps define the term collective security. I will not criticize it but will only raise the point that the desire for security may be only an expression of resistance to change and if change is inevitable wc ha.ve a rather awkward situation. Y,re are only a whole body of nations trying to stop the inevitable. In support of the question, I can only say that all of you who have any acquaintance with politics that fear of change is an emotion that is only less strong than fear of pain. The communist theory is that the resistance is so strong that It can only be overcome by revolution. Collective security, there&#172; fore may be mere resistance to change and some of those changes may be necessary to enable nations to maintain their populations. Unless collective security is accom&#172; panied by some ineans by which can be promoted and rendered safe, it may easily be&#172; come a menace, though it may be a moans of making the change safe. It is rather im-</essay:p>

            <essay:p>portant to notice that another expression of the resistance to change may be in armaments and the connection between the two under the league plan of salvation is somewhat erroneous. Sanctions are a sanctified form of the blockade, I feel very strongly that the League may very well be an agency for peaceful change if armaments are so reduced as not to be a major factor. Then sanctions may be a police measure. But the arming of police with machine guns - is not productive of law and order. In the present condition of tho world, armaments dominate the scone, they increase the resistance to change without reducing its necessity or tempo and hurry it on to calamity. Nor is aggression a simple problem. If changes are necessary to accommodate increasing populations, may not aggression be the only way out for increasing populations? YJhatevor tribunals you sot up must decide on tho present order and cannot ad&#172; judicate on change. We must recognize change and promote it. I am afraid I am becoming an impossibilist. But all I am saying is that we must recognise change and promote it. It is inevitable, it is the demand cf new forces, now minds and souls for recognition# It is unfortunate that we cannot direct it better but we have no adequate machinery for the problem precipitated upon us. This leads us to a dilemma which is very deep. Our difficulty may be that there is no solution to the problem of change along the linos to which we have been accustomed. There is certainly no solution along the lines of forced arma&#172; ments. The great war arose out of the demand for change which was. resisted. After four years of slaughter, changes of the most far-reaching and disastrous charac&#172; ter were brought into operation. That change then demanded could not have been adjusted because it was wrongly interpreted as mere aggression which indeed was the form it took. Force is no remedy and armaments reduce all machinery to futility. I have :\o doubt that all problems of change could be solved on the economical plane if we were all intelligent and allowed changes to take place which can justify themselves. Our old enemy &quot;laissez-faire&quot; had some good points. The point is that we are not intelligent and a solution of perfectly soluble problems on economic lines seems more improbable than anything else. The result is that the only solution must be the ethical solutions and in&#172; deed it is true that change cannot come about writhout sacrifice. If the change is to be peaceful that sacrifice, must be voluntary. In other words, collective security may be a menace but a collective system in which the problems of the world are viewed as a whole and their meaning recognized and the responsibility of making the changes necessary for peace is placed on the leading members with&#172; out compulsion, is still a feasible system. It can, of course, only be successful if the responsibility of tho greatest nations tc: make the sacrifice is accepted in a spirit of noblesse oblige. If it wore recognized that an Empire which owns 1/5 of the earth&apos;s surface cannot havo an exclusive block, or that the nation which has the greatest accumulation of resources and wealth cannot have the high&#172; est tariff and the largest navy, we should be nearer peo.ee. In any case, enor&#172; mous strides to peace might be made if there wore a proportionate reduction of armaments . Not because security was obtained by political settlements but because people were willing to take risks and did not regard change as the chief risk. Let me say a few words about the Pacific In conclusion. The dangers in the Pacific are essentially the same as in other parts of tho world. The industrial&#172; ized nations of western Europe find in the Pacific markets which help to maintain their populations. But the other populations of the Pacific desire to be treated as ends in themselves and build up balanced communities in which a full life self- determined economically as well as pclitcally is possible. If this aspiration - of the newer nations is realized, tho ambitions of foreign nations is reduccd. Japan demands access to foreign markets to maintain her population and everybody</essay:p>

            <essay:p>is afraid of these markets and adopts restrictive legislation* As markets are closed the line of least resistance, which happens to be China, is taken. Here is the essential position of the Pacific. It is relatively a far more simple and feasible problem than that of Europe# If china were stable a balance in the Pacific could be obtained. The fact that European nations hold minor interests in the Pacific should not prevent Pacific people from insisting that Pacific problems should be handled by Pacific people along the lines which will lead to the most beneficial development there. The intense problems of Europe are due to the fact that you have proud historic nations with huge industrialized populations crowded together in a relatively small continent with very narrow entrees to the world. The character of the traffic problems of the Pacific is entirely different. The Pacific is spacious and most nations are self-contained, hostile action is difficult, de&#172; fense is easy, and we should insist that those advantages be retained. I suggest, therefore, that the terms we use in the discussion on this round table topic should be very carefully considered and the implications should bo carefully studied.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 41 STATEMENT AT PLENARY SESSION ON ROUND TABLE TOPIC V. August 29, 1936 (V. E. Mo.tylov) In the course of the discussion of the last topic of our agenda the fact of the economic, political and military grovfth of the USSR and its defensive power has attracted not less attention, than during the discussion on previous topics. This growth, which one of the distinguished delegates at this conference characterized as a dramatical one, has been widely recognized as an outstanding factor of the Pacific relations, and, as it seems to me, has been recognized by at least a majority of this Conference as a powerful factor for peace in this region of the world. I consider that enough evidence has been given at this Conference, that the growth of the military power of the USSR in general, and in its Far Eastern Region, in particular, not only assures peace at its borders, but also encourages peaceful tendencies in more than one country of the Pacific. Nowadays, weakness and helplessness invito aggression&#8212;the growth of our capacity for defense, on the contrary, chocks aggression and makes it more diffi&#172; cult for aggressive groups to start some now &quot;peaceful changes.&quot; I wish you would for a moment ask yourselves that would be the world sit&#172; uation today if instead of the Union of Soviet Socialistic Republics there were an imperialist Russia* Is it not self-evident that in this case the world long ago would have been thrown into the horrors of a new world war, of a new &quot;red ocean&apos; of blood&quot;, for the sake of selfish interests of a ruling imperialist clique? Is it not self-evident that the existence of a socialist system of ucconomy in our country, eliminating any stimuli for expansion and aggression, is to the real advantage of humanity, thirsting for peace? It is the more important to remind ourselves of these facts at a Conference in which it has become clear enough that the pro-requisites for a collective or&#172; ganization of peace&#8212;which we consider to bo the only real guarantee for peace- do not exist so far in the Pacific region# is known to some of you that I have something to do with geographical studies. Together with a number of my colleagues here I could note that some significant changes are taking place in traditional geography: oceans become more and more narrow, continents get closer to each other, and their intor-do- pendcnce grows stronger. The difficulties of guaranteeing peace in the Pacific should not make the friends of peace fold their hands and recognize fatalistically the inevitability of -war. The organization of collective security in the Pacific,, such as it should be, did not appear at this Conference as a practical possibility of today. But does this mean that all possibilities of safeguarding peace are exhausted and that new forms aro unthinkable which could combine tho peaceful efforts of all interested powers?</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Allow no, as I did already at a round table yesterday, to rccall one practical suggestion which was made by Mr. Litvinov more than two years ago at the clos in.&quot; session of the General Committee of the Disarmament m Gone**. I think that the time has come to remind ourselves of that suggestion again. In making the proposal to transform the Disarmament Conference into a perman&#172; ent institution for the preservation of peace, Mr. Litvinov said: &quot;I propose to transform this conforence into a Permanent Peace Conference, meeting periodically and working for the safeguarding of the security of all nations. So far peace conferences have been convoked^mostly after wars and had as their aim the partition of spoils, the imposition on the van&#172; quished of onerous and humiliating conditions, the redistribution of territories, the remodelling of states&#8212;and thus created sources of now wars. The Conference which I have in mind, must be created for the pre&#172; vention of wars and of their terrible consequences. It should work out, widen and perfect methods of strengthening security, listen in time to warnings of coming war dangers, listen to the &quot;SOS&quot; appeals of meanace states and extend to them a timely possible help, moral, economic, finan&#172; cial, or other. &quot;I foresee references to the League of Nations which by the articles 12, 15, 16 and others so obliged to serve the very aims to which I would like to direct the work of the Conference. But, the League, first, has a great num&#172; ber of tasks, it deals with many matters, great and small,_it was croatcc. at a moment, when many people thought that the danger of war is excluded for many years to come. But now, when we all see the danger of war, ^ thought ^ should bo given to the creation of a special organ, directed in its ac iv:- ity towards one aim, namely the prevention or the lessening of war danger. Secondly, the League of Nations is too much bound by its Covenant. The appeal to it and its decisions are too strictly regulated, while the tribune of the Conference could be made more accessible, more free, more responsibe to the needs of the moment. Let the Conference continue to be an organ of the League and use the machinery of the League, lot it be most closely connected with the League, let it not replace the League, which should fully maintain its prerogatives....But did^not the very con&#172; vocation of the Disarmament Conference prove the insufficiency of the frame-work of the League for such big tasks, as disarmament,&#8212;and my pro&#172; posal deals with greater tasks, namely with the permanent preservation of peace?&quot; Wo heard at this Conference proposals of rather abstract nature regarding so-called peaceful changes, proposals detached from their fundamental pre-requis- ite&#8212;collective security. No one objects and no one could object to an lc.ea, go excellent in itself. But we did not, it seems, notico there any visible pro&#172; gress in the direction of the realization of this idea, on the basis of a vol- untary, equal and sovereign consent of all interested parties. TJowld it net be better if we shoul seriously think over how to make such feasible practical^ changes in the organization of peace, which would constitute a serious handicap to the danger of war? And it is with this idea in my mind that I come back to the practical proposals of Mr. Litvinov, which would make possible the cooperation for peace by all, in all parts oi the world. Ladies and Gentlemenj Our conference is drawing to its end. Whatever the possible practical effects of our work here may be, two facts^are evidenc: xirst, our work has not boon in vain. The factual material at our disposal, the ex&#172; change of opinions&#8212;all this made the situation in the Pacific mere clear to Uo all.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 48 ADDRESS OF HEM I BOM-IE T Special Plenary Session August 26, 1936. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have to speak today on the work of the International Conference of the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, and especially of the preparation of the next session of this &quot;body, which will have to deal with the following subject: &quot;Peaceful solution of certain international problems,&quot; and then a sub-title, &quot;The specific difficulties in and the procedures for the peaceful solution of the economic, social and territorial problems, with special reference to (a) population migration and colonization* (b) markets and dis&#172; tribution of raw materials. If I was so kindly invited to give you some information about this piece of research work, I am sure it v/as not in order to give me the satis&#172; faction and the opportunity of bringing my little contribution to this avalanche cf which Lord Snell was speaking yesterday. Neither was it as an expert in English,, as you perhaps realize already, njr as an expert in economics and other matters, &quot;but because the studies of the International Conference are closely related to the interesting debates you have already had and will have tomorrow and Friday in this Pacific Conference. The subjects which you have discussed have an important bearing on the studies of the International Studies Conference, and we hope also that the inquiries which the Institute of Pacific Relations will make during the coming month will largely contribute to clarify some of the points which will be examined next year, in June, when the International Studies Conference will meet. Having tried to explain - even to justify my presence here - I would be inclined* of course, to add some words on the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation itself, but I shall refrain from doing so, reminding you only that the Institute is the organ of a technical organization of the League &#8222;vf Nations* The aim of this organization is, broadly speaking, to establish direct relations between the organizations, departments, associations, devoted to intellectual, scientific and educational action in our different countries and.to create between them the habit of working in common; of settling, by international methods, the numerous problems which they are all faced with at the same time. Our Chairman, Mr. McDonald, said this morning, that the history of the last fifteen years was made of lost opportunities and that nothing appropriate had ever been done, at the right time. I entirely agree, but one should add that the history of these past years was also entirely made up of deep rooted in&#172; comprehension and misunderstanding* If the peoples of the world are to be able to live in a community of nations while at the same time preserving the high. degree cf independence they enjoy today and their national genius, they must realize and understand what unites them and be able to make some concessions on what could divide them#</essay:p>

            <essay:p>It is true that no human society could exist without rules, but these rules must, in addition, be based en a common morality* It is true also that a widespread consensus of opinion exists in regard to the principles which ouht to rule the international relations - reconciliation of interests; arbitration; international justice, for example6 But the problem remains of converting these principles into notions recognized as the compulsory source of any political act ionc Now, to help in the solution of these very groat problems of inter&#172; national collaboration of thought it was recognized that one should, amongst other activities, think of the qualified representatives of scientific work and research in the field of social sciences and international relations* that an important service would be rendered and at the sane time a specific work of intellectual cooperation would be accomplished. I now come to the second point of this statement, which I should per&#172; haps have begun with, that is, to tell you something about the organization of the International Studies Conference itself. In the third and last part of this statement I shall try to explain in what spirit the very large and complex session will function. The International Studies Conference became a studies conference only five years ago. It had previously been an administrative body for the scientific study of international relations, such as the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, Centre d&apos;Etude de Politique Etrangere, some German, Dutch, Polish and Roumanian institutions, and also some international schools and institutions like the Graduate School of International Studies in Geneva, or the Institute of Pacific Relations itself# It was soon recognized that the best way of promoting research and at the same time promoting real international collaboration in the field of social sciences would be to associate the various members of the Conference in the study of some major problem of international relations, to follow in this respect the example of the Institute of Paci.fic Relationso The first attempt v/as made when a thorough study of the economic life culminated in an International Con&#172; ference held in London in 1933- Then followed the study of the problem of collective security, which led to a similar general conference, which was held last year, and this last conference on collective security explains the choice oi tne present subject to be studied. The Program Committeef when making its decision, intended to continue its research on collective security and to complete the results already obtained by a study of the methods for the removal of the causes of war. But before beginning to speak of the subject itself, I will try to give^you an idea of the organization of the Conference, which is a new,, independ&#172; ent international bodyr autonomous in the frame of the technical organization for intellectual cooperation of the League of Nations. It is composed of about thirty different national groups of institutions dealing either with foreign politics and international relations or at least some aspects of these branches of research* The first success of the conference has clearly been to promote the study of these questions in many countries where this kind of study needed to dc encouraged or developed; and second, to introduce a more effective inter-* national cooperation in a field which requires, perhaps more than any other one?</essay:p>

            <essay:p>the knowledge of the results obtained in other &quot;branches of science, geography, economics, and so on, in the various countries. As a proof, a large number of institutions have recently been created in Europe in order to participate fully in the v/ork of the International Studies Conference and are at present &quot;being organised. They &quot;benefits of course, from the experience of older and well- equipped institutions&#171; They try to place all sorts of facilities at the dis&#172; posal of the individual research workers - &quot;bibliographies, information depart&#172; ments, specialized librariesc They create study groups for the discussion in common of the most interesting, important and acute problems of the day,. And through the new system of liaison, which the Institute of Intellectual Cooperatio has established, they have, apart from this common study of the methods of peaceful settlements of international problems, a good deal of collaboration on other topics. Some of them, for instance, are studying the structure of the new political regimes which have recently been created in other countries of Europe. Others inquire into agrarian problems. They deal also with various important political problems and with social questions, like unemployment and many others, and on these special points the interested bodies have also special liaison and special exchange of views and information. And of course a great number of these institutions ~ they are increas&#172; ing in number every day - like the American or British institutions, issue books of a scientific character, pamphlets and also reviews. New institutions of this kind have in fact been created or reorganized or at least certain coordinating committees, in many countries of Europe - in many countries of Central Europe - Czecho-Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria^ Norway. In Spain a very strong institute was created last year and I hope very much it will escape the consequences of the civil war; in France a new Centre d5Etude de Politique Etrangere; in the United States a new liaison committee has recently been created to have a better liaison with our conference, and the conference of course keeps all its contacts and relations with its older members in Great Britain, several dominions, the Netherlands, in Italy, and so on. Before going further, I would like to insist on the distinctly scienti.f ic character of the conference. These individual members do not think evidently that the philosophers should rule their various nations but they think never&#172; theless that the philosophers can still give some help, as they did in the past, but that would require some developments, and have insisted on the really scien&#172; tific, objective and disinterested character for their conference. We come now I think to the question of positive change. The subject will be dealt with at the next session of the conference. As I told you, it is but the.continuation of the previous work on collective.security, the results of which have been published in book form by the Institute of Intellectual Coop&#172; eration. I am not trying to give a resume of this book. Let me point out, how&#172; ever, that with the exception of perhaps one delegation, there had been in the conference a general consensus of opinion on some very important points. It was agreed that the preservation of peace makes necessary the recognition of certain rules and the acceptance of the consequences which they involve for international relations. The idea of the prevention of war has given rise to the whole questic of new relations between nations. In approaching this vast and complex question the conference had been led to.make a special point of discussing the principle of the organization of pacific systems destined to eliminate the causes of war to the fullest possible extent.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>I must say that previously of course tliey had discussed also the question of repression of war in its various aspects; they had made a searching examination of the notion of neutrality, &quot;but an important part of the delibera&#172; tions was devoted to the problem of the prevention of war and amongst other points one was unanimously recognized, that in order to fight against war with amy chances of success it is necessary to concentrate upon its causes &quot;by looking for the pacific means of settlement of disputes which could lead up to war. And it was also recognized that these conflicts are in most cases connected with claims, founded or not, with aspirations which should find satisfaction or any&#172; how &quot;be dealt with in the existing juridical order. Many of the distinguished scholars and international lav/yers who were present at the London conference would certainly have &quot;been able to discuss this question theoretically. They refrained nevertheless from doing so; to envisage procedures for Article 19 of the Covenant of the League of the creation of tribunals or committees. They thought - rightly I think - that they should em&#172; bark on a new series of studies, the material for which will be furnished by the questions I already referred to - questions of population, colonies, raw materials and markets. The procedures to be employed to deal with these questions are of very great variety, and it seems to be a good method to approach the fundamental difficulties and to turn the attention to the positive procedures only after having made sufficient progress in the initial part of the undertaking. I can&#172; not, having already been too long, I am sure, explain what are the proposals of the national groups, - the studies they have undertaken and the nature of the interim reports sent to the preparatory meeting of the conference, held at Madrid in June last. I will just try to give you some indications of the work already adopted. This work to be undertaken involves, above all, a critical analysis of the requirements in support of a request for any form of peaceful change, and an analysis of the obstacles or resistance opposed to such claims. All claims for change are not justified. Some may be exaggerated. They may be sometimes&apos; legitimate in principle but dangerous in the solutions they demand or the methods they recomr.iendo And of course this study of the difficulties and the obstacles must be completed by analysis of the solutions existing. As for the first question - the question of raw materials - some days ago in our round tables we discussed the so-called question of raw materials in the Far East, and I noticed that it was not a very easy one. Somebody raised a very important point: whether the claim for raw material was made in view of the preparation for war or to facilitate the economic life of a country and its citizens. It is a very important point, but many others come to mind that re&#172; quire a good deal of preliminary documentation first, which the various national groups and members are collecting, for instance, on the national consumption and production of raw materials. Are they imported from abroad or colonial countries&apos;! It requires, above all, a comparison of the economic conditions of supply, of cost prices, and.of the real, existing obstacles, if any, to the free supnly of raw materials, and also a study of the policies envisaged by countries lacking in raw materials. What is the cost price of raw materials produced in the home country; of raw materials imported from the colonies; of the colonial territories which, for one reason or another, have adopted the open door policy? What are also the rates of interest and dividends of national undertakings producing raw</essay:p>

            <essay:p>materials in the hone countries or in foreign lands? What are, in fact, the ex.- isting restrictions on the export of raw materials, fiscal duties, restrictions &quot;by groups of producers, restrictions, also, on the importation of raw materials- I will only quote as an example an American .&quot;roup, which created a special committee to investigate the more important aspects of the problem, com&#172; posed of scholars of many American universities - Princeton, Chicago, the Univers&#172; ity of Wisconsin, of Minnesota, of the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Brookings Institute. As for colonies, I shall not try to go into details. Hie crucial poinc will he a thorough study made &quot;by many groups - the French, British, Dutch, per&#172; haps a Portuguese group and a German (group - of the real value of colonies. What are the advantages and drawbacks of the possession of colonies from the economic standpoint as well as from the political and moral standpoint. Also a study of the solution suggested in the light first of non-controversial regions like the Congo Basin, or of the mandate system, and also taking into account the possibilities of territorial changes. We will study also the questions relating to the status of foreign colonies and the investment of foreign capital. It is easy to see there will be some difficulties and differences of opinion on this question of colonies, even on the definition and still more on the redistribution of colonies and the extension of the mandate system. Especially will there be differences of opinion when the confsrence comes to the study of the very important problem of migration, a question alluded to in our present conference and which plays a greater role in other parts of the world than the Pacific area. There again concrete problems are being studied ~ the problem of the assimilation of the immigrant; possibilities of habitation for different races in areas like to receive immigrants, and so on. I would also lite to point out that some .groups are concentrating their attention 011 the problem of over-population. When can it be said that a state is over-populated? What are the principal criteria of over-population? I think the mere enunciation of these problems reminds you of many points on which public opinion in all countries neerls to be better informed upon and to profit from the results of objective studies of the facts and also of the policies which are followed by some nations. The last thing I have to say is that from the point of view of organ&#172; ization there is a permanent coordination between all these parallel researchers- It is assured in three ways: Through the officials of the Institute of Intel&#172; lectual Cooperation; second, by a general rapporteur assisted by four deputy rapporteurs; and third, by international committees of experts which meet from time to time. We have already had meetings of these international groups on each of the big problems - population, colonies, etc. I shall mention especially one of them, the Danubian group. The Conference decided to include in its program, as an example of a complete and concrete problem the territorial and social aspects of the Danubian problem and this proposal, it is interesting to note, came from the Institute in Vienna and in Bucharest. It was accepted by the six</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 45 STATEMENT MADE AT PLENARY SESSION ON ROUND TABLE TOPIC V. August 29, 1936 (Albert Sarraut) Again I am honored&#8212;this time to say the last words of this conference, or better still, to refer to the witty speech delivered to us a few evenings ago by Lord Snell, and literally to pour forth the last waves of the avalanche of elo&#172; quence# I wish to place myself immediately under the invocation of one of the first kings of France, whom they called Pepin le Bref, because he was of a very short stature.. I am no king for the time being; my name is not Pepin, and I am not so much of a dwarf, but I shall be brief. I now give you the pleasure of my promise to be brief. Because of that promise, I shall put aside tho natural temptation which comes to me to extract and to resume, in this last speech, the political and moral philo&#172; sophy wiich can very well be drawn from the labors of this conference. That would be intensely interesting, but too long. Nothing is as long as a summary. Y/hen a man tells you that he is intending to summarize, bewardl The only exception to that rule which I know of is the summary given by the excellent rapporteur this morn?lng, and I hope you will permit me to congratulate him together with the other fine speakers of the morning. It is a great personal pleasure for me to refer to the worthy interests of our discussions of the past fortnight. Naturally, I would have preferred, not by national pride, but because of personal convenience, that the conferences had taken place in French, but if some of the Ideas have by chance escaped me here and there, I have, nevertheless, been impressed by the science, by the depth of thought, the documentation, and by the good faith of all of those who have analyzed the great problems which ive have tried to solve. I really take away with me a very high es- time for this conference; I donTt regret my long journey, and already I dream of purchasing my ticket for the next international meeting of the Institute three years hence-~if, of course, the good Good permits mo to live, and I see no special reason why he should not do so. I hope to find again at that time the same faces, the same assembly, both masculine and feminine; they would not understand that a Frenchman, unless he were very depressed, would miss the opportunity of&apos; paying his respects to what we call in French the &quot;weaker sex.&quot; Probably to vindicate our&#172; selves, and because we feel that the intelligence and the heart of woman is In&#172; finitely superior to that of man, we draw up Civil Codes to chain the power of this &quot;weaker sex.&quot; Those are our weapons of Collective-Security. We shall have inscribed in the annals of this magnificent and enchanting valley, if not concrete results, at least the strength of a groat will in the direction of the preservation of peace in the Pacific area. And so, we will not have spoiled the valley by bellicose attitudes, by words of resentment or hostility and the magnificent frame-work of Nature will have merited our respect. This same Nature gives to us a lesson of peace in its very serenity, in its colm, and by its security for these charming animals who live here among tho trees without fear, and without appryhoiisi&apos;Vii .of the Law of the Jungle&#8212;even without fearing man, since it is for&#172; bidden to kill here. what a beautiful thing if the same restraint could be extended one day to the human life and to the life of all the nations! Is all hope forbidden in this respect? Soiriotines it has occurred to me here in the great tranquility of these beautiful evenings, when the valley is enveloped in shadows and when the soft moon is illuminating the lofty haughtiness of the valley walls themselves in its</essay:p>

            <essay:p>silvery light, and. I said to myself that : &quot;Yle too arc do\m in the shadow; we are still in the shadow full of fears and menaces where we don&apos;t see clearly, where our prejedices, our instincts, our errors, and our ignorance buffet one another together into a confused scramble which can become murderous. But there is a higher light above; it is the light towards which we should move because of its serenity&#8212;towards its truth, its sweetness, and towards the peace which it showers upon us, when wo shall have the will and the courage to attain the very crest of free reason&#8212;the heights where wisdom reigns in a fresh life- giving atmosphere. It is impossible to &quot;understand ourselves, to realize that we are all human, to live near each other affectionately and in confidence buffeting against insoluble difficulties? Here again the lesson of the valley comes to my mind. For the past fourteen days we have lived near one another in a charming international life&#8212; it was a universe in miniature; our different races have mixed easily in cordial relations towards which each one contributed his smiles and the best he could give; we exchanged in a brotherly way the pure water and &apos;che tomatoe juice; .Americans and Japanese ladies have danced to the same rhythm; Russians and Chinese ladies have shared the pleasures of the same blues; and with jolly enthusiasm the mas&#172; culine and feminine representatives of three-fourths of the universe have mixed the bubblings of their cheerfulness in the rapprochements of the barbeque. V.&apos;hy not try to carry over into the complex life of the world the spirit which enchanted our cordial little life here in the valley? It is already such a^short life that we have&#8212;why put into it tho conflicts and miseries of nations? All our people need peo.ee; no one, however heroic, desires deliberately to permit, kill&#172; ing or to kill his neighbor. V-ar is not the normal state of humanity. War doesn&apos;t pay; war is not in itself an ideal. The great efforts of mankind have been strained for centuries and centuries so that the life of our cities might be full of clear joy and of happy tasks, and not so that the streets should run red mth blood, be burned by fire or strewn with corpses. Undoubtedly such &quot;joy is necessary for all, some liberty for all, some justice for all, and some sun for all. Everyone ought to have his place in the sun&#8212;we must strive together in a friendly fashion close to one another, lihat wg cannot do, what none of us can do, is to relinquish his place and to re-enter the shadow, taking his flag with him in abdication of his own civilization; for by so doing he would be injuring humanity as much as himself. Our civilizations are not irreconcilable; they are not contradictory; I have never believed, I irould never believe in the &quot;inevitable&quot; hostility of tho East and the ITest. I think that to the contrary we can mix the brightness and tho beauties of these civilizations, as tho most different flowers combine themselves together to make up the harmony of a splendid garden. May each one of us bring his best seeds for composing the magnificent blossoming of the garden of peace} In this way we shall be worthy of our title as men. May God help us and bless us, because He wishes peace to all men of good will.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 44 STATEMENT FOR PLENARY SESSION ON ROUND TABLE TOPIC V, AUGUST 29,1936 (The Rt, Hon, A,V. Alexander, M.P#) Mr. Chairman and friends: # It is always a difficult task for any speaker at the end of a conference of the importance and the breadth of scope of inquiry such as that we have just come to the conclusion of, to address himself objectively to what wo have dis&#172; cussed in the limited time that can be afforded. I think that you will all agree that the distinguished statesman and progressive leader of a groat nation in the Far East has displayed already this morning a most admirable spirit. (Hear, hoarJ ) Instead perhaps as some of us would be tempted to do, to look at some of the things that have been said during the conference and make what we call in London a &quot;snappy answer&quot; to the particular. points, I think it is a very good thing indeed the, this plenary session should find how much we can really take away with us from this conference for the building of the house, the spiritual and moral house, which it is the real task of the Institute of Pacific Relations to assist, the house for the improvement of the mutual relations between the nations in the region that we set for our objective study. I asked at the outset of the discussion dealing with Japan that we should be frank. We have had lots of jokes about frankness since. But I think that all of us will admit that there has been a vast amount of frank expression of view in the course of this conference. And I think it is one of the triumphs of the organization of the Institute of Pacific Relations that we, in the present world circumstances of strain to which Mr, Yoshizawa has just referred, could gather from so many countries such eminent and distinguished scholars, students, and other people, economists and so on, and speak with the amount of frankness that wo have spoken at this conference. Now in the world situation to which Mr, Yoshizawa has referred, we only really in this plenary session have the task of looking retrospectively a little at what we have learned from each other and form a determination to make the fullest possible use of this great institution of I think growing strength, the Institute of Pacific Relations, and apply it to the great task of the construction of peace in the future. The shadow of impending war is not confinod to the kind of disturbing headline that came into the Valley this week. The shadow of impondm war is much more real. I confess to you that I have felt for a year past, and I feel it today very much in the spirit of those lines of Edgar Allen Poe, &quot;And the raven never flitting still is sitting, still is sitting, on the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door,,.,, and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, Shall be lifted never more&quot; &#8226; and that seems to me to have been largely the spirit which has gripped the Y/orld in the last 12 months. It is the task of the removal of that spirit in mutual relationships of nations the.&quot; is the real task of the Institute of Pacific Relations - not for us to feel that we arc fatalistically committed to the feeling that we are as in a dream of night like those who would fly but dare not from a danger nigh. The only way wo can. do that is to exchange knowledge and make that knowledge a real power for peace. I had felt very great temptation last Tuesday week to reply to a very brilliant, rhetorical, and knowledgeable speech on naval affairs by Mr, Chester Rowel1, but amidst all the days of temporary irritations, I hope I have learned</essay:p>

            <essay:p>patience and restraint during this Institute of Pacific Relations Conference, and I confine myself in thinking of the changing balance of forccs and the use of force and the use of diplomacy, to only this single comment upon that brilliant speech, that the policy that he so graphically described as having been initiated by John Hay was net really achieved by the power of the big gun behind the diplomat&apos; - because at that time I would not have regarded the United States as a very powerful naval force - and diplomacy in the future which is really backed by good will and met half way by the good will of other nations can be successful in improving mutual relationships and building peace. Nevertheless, in the field of the more technical discussions that we have had and to which Mr. Yoshizawa has referred today, there is a vast amount of work to be done. I confess, Mr, Yoshizawa, that I have learned more about Japan in the past fourteen days in that inscrutable face of ^r, Yoshizawa&apos;s, than I have learned from the study of many books and perhaps what too often are in the nature of propaganda pamphlets. Certainly those of us in the British delegation who had certain objectives in mind, while wo may feel with Mr. Yoshizawa that we have not reached all the satisfactory conclusions that wo would desire, have learned so much that wo have material in our hands to go back and work in our nation. And we hope that that is the position of every other delegation. We have discussed population difficulties, economic relations, political questions, and on all these points ^ feel I can speak for the British delegation when I say that we have learned things from this conference that should help us to load the nations in the path suggested by the previous speaker. In regard to our relationships in trade with Japan, I feel confident - and I hope that Mr, Carter and those who have worked so hard with him in the Secretariat will take note of this - I feel confident that our exchange of views with our Japanese friends on the removal of difficulties in trade relations are going to be of extreme value and that what we are going to say to our people in England - and they in Tokyo - will lead to a removal, not at once perhaps but gradually, by good will, of many of the sources of irritation and barriers in our actual trade relationships. In regard to the constructive machinery of peace, I of course must take note of the views expressed by our friends from Japan about the difficulties they see in the suggestions which have been made in that direction, I havo equally taken note of the references which have been made, not always to the same, but perhaps similar difficulties put by the delegates from the United States. But I am more than ever convinced, and I hope my friends will agroo with me - I am more than ever convinced from our conversations that there will be no lasting peace with justice in the world until there is a properly erected machine for the construction of collective security, a collective security which will not leave the settlement as to whether justice is being done to those whose cause is being tried, but will leave it to the judgment of the nations of the world, assembled not in political order but assembled through duly appointed legalistic persons, jurists impartial, making their decisions with the guidance of the growing precedents of international law, I feel, too, that I ought to say that whilst wo have had very interesting discussions, with regard to regional pacts that we shall have to apply in our respective countries a great deal of thought and time to that question before we can really link into the minds of the peopl c the real world responsibility for peace with the regional action that requires to be taken, I am obliged, although I have been critical during this conference about the more academic side, I am obliged for the help and tho learning that we havo received upon those points from those who have made a study of intornational law. But above all although I have very little time left, ^ should like to end what I have to say this morning on a general note - I feel that there is always a danger both in the</essay:p>

            <essay:p>conferences of statesmen, in the more formal councils, and in the assemblies of such study conferences as we have hero today, that we all may be tempted to magnify our own point of view, that we may on occasion even feel individual and intellectual pride in our particular contribution at a given time, and there&#172; after leave the sphere of cur conference and our speech and think that wo havo very nearly done all that is required, forgetful, as I said to my round table yesterday, what the real problem is, the real problem of how, if I may requote some words I used last Tuesday, of how to bring to the great toiling masses of all the nations as individuals in those toiling masses, the right to know, and to enjoy, all the best that life can offer in the sphere of knowledge, emotion and hope. When I think of the conferences, I have been in with statesmen in political parties, or in such studies as this, I feel oppressed with the sense that over and over again the real case of these toiling masses is overlooked to a very large extent&#174; They are pawns in the game, just moved like chessmen in the great struggle, to be used afterwards for cannon fodder# I should like to feel &quot;that as we leave this conference today in the words of Mr. Yoshizawa we shall each opply at once not from the point of view of the personal projection of our own view but from the point of view of the colloctivo knowledge we have ob&#172; tained and the personal understanding on the other hand of the difficulties of tho other nations &#171; apply ourselves to removing the barriers. For that reason I must emphasize one othor thing, and I hope tho people who do not agree with me on this point will forgive me &#8212; that the people who drafted the agenda of this con&#172; ference, probably none of them members of my political school of thought, were right when they included in the subject of discussion tho necessity of consider&#172; ing the question of internal adjustment of economic and social and industrial questions, if we aro really going to bring into our perspective of the improvement of mutual relations between the nations in the future, the whole of the needs of the toiling masses, we have got to be prepared to consider improvements in that direction# We have vast improvements still to make in Britain# I see as I travel in the United States vast improvements still necessary to bo made if you arc going to solve the problem of the increasing output per unit of labor of production of wealth, with the comparatively static rate of consumption per unit of labor#. I see in Japan*s trouble in the East today - although I do not shut out her need for biological expansion &#8212; a need for social and economic adjustment internally&#8222; Let us gather these forces together, let us not go away completely pessimistic^ but apply ourselves to tho task of rebuilding, if we can humanity, in the highest and the noblest form, looking at the objective which Tennyson once put before us in four very short linos when he looked to the day when we should &quot;Hear no more the yelp of the boast, and man is quiet at last, as he stands on the height of his life, with a glimpse of tho height that is higher#&quot;</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 43 STATEMENT AT PLENARY SESSION ON ROUND TABLE TOPIC V August 29, 1936 (K# Yoshizawa) From different parts of the woirld, filled to a greater or lesser extent with fear and apprehension, have we come to this wonderful valley of Yosemite with a hope and expectation of finding out some means by which to alleviate troubles in the Pacific. Over the past two weeks we did exchange candid views and frank opinions, but evidently difficulties confronting us were so groat that we were unablo to attain concrete results satisfactory to all of us. We have been enlightened, however, as to the real nature of the problems facing us, and wo have learned anew that the world has not attained the degree of pcrfoction which would enable us to realize our ideal of peace in the immediate future. Somo of us, maybe, will be leaving this Con&#172; ference with a distinct note of pessimism.} somo of us with a brightened feeling in tho anticipation of a better future. But most of us undoubtedly will leave this place with a conviction that more retrospect, exertion, and perhaps sacrifico shall be needed on the part of all of us boforo we reach any satisfactory solution of our problems. Round Table Topic V, needless to say, occupied the most prominent position in the whole Conference pro&#172; gram, and under this topic we discussed the changing balance of forces in the Pacific and the possibilities of peaceful adjustment. In the course of our discussion, the question of a possible revision of tho Nine Power Treaty attracted a considerable amount of our attention . . . a question which to some of us appeared to be pertinent in tho changed situation in the Far East today. This question, however, subsequently led to more general discussions of collective security for the Pacific countries. And the central point in that question was how to devise a peace machinery fully compatible to peaceful change in the relation between different countries&#171; To illustrator prior to the World War, the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was an important factor in tho political balance of the Far East. At the Yfashington Conference, various treaties were signed and resolutions adopted with a view to stabilizing the political situation in that area. Unfortunately, soon after, conditions began to change radically, making the practical operation of the foregoing international implements in&#172; operative . If the proposed now machinery is to bo based upon sanctions, I would like to call attention to the practical difficulties involved, which are well illustrated in the recent difficulties of the League of Nations. The necessity must be realized, therefore, of further examination of such proposals before&apos;their actual incorporation into any form of peace machinery. I think that Japan v/ould regard the question of sanctions with grave concern. Although some of the members have expressed themselves very bluntly with regard to the possible application of sanctions, It is highly doubtful if such application would achieve the desired result. I may further state that in the consideration of any proposed colle ctive security system based upon sanctions, it is imperative that we</essay:p>

Wo have cone here to consider whether peaceful change in the Pacific is possible and how# We start with the promise that peace is desirable and that change is inevitable. This Conference will have done a historic work if it will have outlined, no matter how tentatively, the path along which peace and progress may meet. During the ten days that we have been meeting here, we have been presented with a mass of vital information on the nature and extent of the profound changes which are transforming the Far East, and we have listened to frank, though differing interpretations of the meaning and causes of these changes# We cannot but be fully aware of the portent of our discussions# It would not be in harmony with the spirit of candor and with the eager search for the truth which have marked this Conference if we did not admit clearly and unequivocally the seriousness of the situation in the Far East and the difficulties which beset any effort for composing conflicts through cooper&#172; ation# Y(g may be even more emphatic. Probably not since the religious wars of the sixteenth century has there been such a manifestation of doc&#172; trinal intolerance, emotional vehemence, and of such passion for intergroup destruction as is shown today in different parts of the world# If, despite all these difficulties, we face our problem here with faith^ it is because of the evidence we have that never before was there such widespread and genuine abhorence of war and such hope that someone will somehow help to exorcise the specter of another conflagration which haunts the v/orld both East and West# II. In our various sessions we have examined in considerable detail the concrete facts of the changing world situation and specific proposals for allaying the present conflicts# We have emphasized particularly the industrial&#172; ization and trade expansion of Japan, the economic dislocations of the Wostern countries, the disruption of traditional commercial and monetary policies everywhere and the friction between different social systems# In these, we have found the main, immediate causes of the present troubles of the world, and we have sought concrete remedies for these troublee# Our discussions have thus prepared us for what seems to me the larger task of examining the general aspects of the problem of peaceful change# In the brief time allotted to me this evening, I should like to state these general aspects and then indicato briefly how the work of the International Labor Organization - the I#L&#171;0# - fits into the general setting# In broad outline, the major conflicts not only in the Pacific but everywhere may be traced to four processes or causes# First, is the in&#172; equality in the rate of the economic and social development of different</essay:p>

            <essay:p>countries&#174; Second, is the unequal rate at which different social groups within each country develop and with which they can influence national policies# Third, is the desire of each nation or country to obtain an in&#172; creasing share of the world&apos;s goods - whether of world trade, territory, political power, or cultural ascendancy. And fourth, is the indiscriminate and potentially or actually violent character of the .methods used to achieve such ends# In more general terms, it is the differences in the tempo of current changes, in their direction, in the inequalities of benefits derived, and in methods used that give rise to the threatening conflicts of today. It has been recognized in our round-table discussions that a solution of present day conflicts depends upon our ability to reconcile the tempo and direction of the industrial and social changes in different countries and to equalize their benefits. There have even been suggestions that the countries now in process of rapid expansion should moderate their tempo in order to minimize the dislocations in other countries.. That seems to me a dubious approach to the problem, and in contradiction to some of the basic ideas of this Conference. It is not a question whether one or another country should be asked to make &quot;sacrificial abstentions&quot; in favor of another. The matter goes much doepor. Expansion is the very essence of all life, and es&#172; pecially of economic and social life. The rate at which such expansion takes place varies from time to time, but when any nation shows extraordinary vitality it would be against the interests of all mankind to suppress or repress it&#187; The best way in which the economic expansion of a young nation may be harmonized with world needs is to guide such expansion in accordance with the highest concepts and standards of social justice. In other words, tho tempo at which a- nation may expand can be modified by policies which adjust the external expansion of a nation to the relative advance of the less favored social groups within the nation. A positive program of peace thus depends on our capacity to organize on a mutual basis not only world trade and world finance, but also the dis&#172; tribution of world power and the relative toleration of different systems of ideas and doctrines. Much has been said here about the peaceful coexistence of different social creeds and systems. May I call ycur attention to tho fact that in its early stages, every new political and social system displays much belligerency and proselyting zeal* That is a way of making a place for itself and of sowing its seeds&#174; But in the course of time, while each system spreads, it undergoes modifications, and a modus vivondi is established between various systems. Protestantism and Catholicism find it possible to livo to&#172; gether; certainly, the varieties of democracy in the nineteenth century were not entirely in accord with the prophecies of Joan Jacques Rousseau, and we are witnessing today the gradual adaptation of collectivist and individualist economic principles in national economies. On the basis of these and other general considerations, which I have no time to develop hore,_ I venture to formulo.te four basis principles for achieving peaceful change: First, changes must take place on a more or less universal scale and simulatncously, for instance, if Japan is to make changes in the structure and methods of its textile industry, corresponding readjustments should be made in Lancashire or the U.S.A. This is the principle of universality. Second, the relative position of the different nations in world markets must be so adjusted as to eliminate monopolistic privileges. That is the principle of equalization of benefits.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Third, tho industrial and economic expansion of new nations should proceed in accordance with labor standards developed &quot;by the more advanced nations# This is the principle of social justice and higher standards of living. Fourth, largo changes cannot bo made peacefully unless they arc prepared for. The question is asked why with so much peace machinery in the world, the cause of peace is so frail, I venture to suggest that ineffective as the various mechanisms may appear, they have been an important factor in putting off major international conflicts. But I would also point out what seems to me a basic weakness in existing international machinery. It is negative in that it either prohibits one thing or another and contains pro&#172; visions not to do things. Or it is dilatory in the sense that it cannot bo brought into action until difficulties have arisen and tho elements of con&#172; flict have developed to a serious stage. As a result, many an effort to readjustment comes too lato in the game. It is nocossary to recognizo that change is a continuous procoss and that what is needed is permanent machinery to guide itf This is the principle of planful change0 III. It is because it operates on the basis of the above principles that the International Labor Organization, tho I,L,0, - is, in my opinion, tho most significant instrument of peaceful change in its field., The IoLr,0&#8222; which is an association of 61 states, including the U,S&#187;A&#8222;, follows in its work the principle of universality. The draft conventions - or international labor treaties - which it adopts at its annual Conferences - aro intended for adoption by all the states which are members of tho I&#187;Lo0, The purpose of those draft conventions is to improve working conditions everywhere and to raise the standards of living of workers in all countries, thus tending to bring about greater equality of tho benefits derived from industrial develop&#172; ment# The I&#171;L&#174;0, is a permanent organization with a positive and definite program of ]a bor roporms which it tries to put into operation steadily and systematically* The program of the I,L,0, implies tho necessity of peace&#172; ful change, and the work of the I,L,0, consists largely in mapping out the concrete measures and draft conventions by which such changes may be effected for the benefit of the industrial population. Time doos not permit mo to cite concrete illustrations of the way in which those general principles are applied in practice. But I beg your indulgence for a concrcte illustration bearing upon the situation in the Far East - Japan has been a member of the I,L,0, since 1919, In the 17 years of its oxistence the ^&#8222;L,09 has adopted at its annual Conferences ovor 50 draft conventions. Those cover a variety of problons, such as the age of admission to industry, social insurance, hours of labor, employment of seamen, machinery for fixing minimum wages, etc. Of these 51 or 52 draft conventions Japan has ratified 13# These conventions fix minimum standards of workmen*s compensation for accident, the age of admission of young workers at sea, medical examination of workers on board ship, limiting or prohibiting night work in bakorios, fixing hours of work in commercial enterprises, etc. The point which I wish to emphasize here is this. By adopting the draft conventions of the I,L,0,, Japan improves the condition of her workers, raises their consuming and purchasing power, and indiroctly adjusts the rate of its industrial development to a pace which is more in accord with conditions in more advanced countries.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>To put it briefly, tho I.L.O. is contributing to peaceful change by helping to raise the standards of living of the workers in all countries. By doing so, the I.L.O. helps to bring about a better balance between the growth of the internal market and foreign trade expansion^ By having its draft conventions rativied, the I.L.O. lifts international trade competition to a higher level. We have talked in our round tables about the effects of lower standards of living on international trade. Much has been said about the incomparability of different standards in different countries* It is true there is an important psychological and traditional element in the con&#172; cept of*the standard of living. But this can and is much exaggerated. There are two facts which should be kept in mind. In the first place, diets arc becoming more and more a matter of scientific study and determination. No country in tho world can claim today that its entire population enjoys an adequate diet&#169; Secondly, whatever the concept of the standard of life is in different countries - whether it emphasizes leisure or security or mobility or aesthetics - the mass of the people need a much larger income than they earn today to enjoy the standard they value. IV. The International Labor Organization has found it necessary, in pursuing its basic aims, to expand its work. At the present time, the IaLeO&#169; is studying problems of workers1 nutrition, with a view to promoting better and more rational diets among workers in all countries. It is now engagea in a comprehensive survey of the textile industry of the world vn.fi a view to suggesting a program for its rational reorganization. But, in its essence, the program of the I.L.O. is concerned with industrial relations and social justice. While its jurisdiction may expand, it leaves a wide field of international economic and social relations un&#172; touched. What the experience of the I.L.O. suggests, however, is the pos&#172; sibility of applying its methods to other fields. What seems to he neoded for the promotion of peaceful change is the reorganization of oth6r inter&#172; national institutions on the same basis of a definite and positive program animated by the same principles of universality, equalization of oppor&#172; tunity, and systematic study of the ways and means by which conflict may be composed and adjusted. I cannot examine this in detail but I have sug&#172; gested in the past that permanent international committees for tho consider&#172; ation of problems of raw materials, finance, colonies, etc. be established. Such committees would be supplementary to some existing machinery and also to the idea of general economic conferences. VJo have had some disheartening experiences with general conferences. It has been ironically pointed out by one speaker that tho General Economic Conference increased tho trend towards national self-sufficiency, that the disarmament conference resulted in a new race for armaments, etc. This must be taken with a grain of salt. The General Conferences have also had important positive results, but it is true that tho whole conception of international conferences needs reexamination. A general conference can be successful only if it is hitched to a permanently working mechanism which can give it direction and technical aid. In brief, the question is how to endow peace with a positive pro&#172; gram and how to devise machinery in the form of definite economic, social and political institutions which can map tho coursc of world development in such a way as to anticipate and obviate conflicts before they bocomo sur&#172; charged with psychological complications. This means tho organization of world industries and of tho world market in such a way as to form a system of mutual interests.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>V. Thcro is no real conflict between the picccneal procedures which have been urged upon us this morning and the general principles stated above. The daily intercourse of peoples gives rise to specific and concrete issues which call for specific and concrete handling&#174; But such concrete procedures are likely to be more successful if they arc in line with well-considered general policies. To develop the simile used by one of the speakers this morning, if the ship must proceed slowly among the reefs and rocks of the seas, it can only do so when the pilot knows what his destination is. It is the goal that determines the route and not vice versa. A current of grim realism has run through the deliberations of this Conference, There has been evident a sense of the grave danger of War in the East and West# Nevertheless, this feeling of apprehension has not weakened the effort to find a rational way out. Those seeking rationality in life may not always succeed, but without their effort the ravajos of unreason would be far greater&#171; To put it in a paradox, the less the apparent chances for its success, the greater the need for rational effort. The real issue is - can we cease being the victims of change and bocomo its guides in the inter&#172; ests of a peaceful huaanity?</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Secretariat 1936 Document 45 STATEMENT MADE AT PLENARY SESSION ON ROUND TABLE TOPIC V. August 29, 1936 (Albert Sarraut) Again I am honored&#8212;this time to say the last words of this conference, or better still, to refer to the witty speech delivered to us a few evenings ago by Lord Snell, and literally to pour forth the last waves of the avalanche of elo&#172; quence. I wish to place myself immediately under the invocation of one of the first kings of France, whom they called Pepin le Bref, because he was of a very short stature.. I am no king for the time being; my name is not Pepin, and I am. not so much of a dwarf, but I shall be brief. I now give you the pleasure of my promise to be brief. Because of that promise, I shall put aside the natural temptation which comes to me to extract and to resume, in this last speech, the political and moral philo&#172; sophy wiich can very well be drawn from the labors of this conference. That would be intensely interesting, but too long. Nothing is as long as a summary. &quot;.Then a man tells you that he is intending to summarize, bewardl The only exception to that rule which I know of is the summary given by the excellent rapporteur this morning, and I hope you will permit me to congratulate him together with the other fine speakers of the morning. It is a great personal pleasure for me to refer to the worthy interests of our discussions of the past fortnight. Naturally, I would ha\re preferred, not by national pride, but because of personal convenience, that the conferences had taken place in French, but if some of the ideas have by chance escaped me here and there, I have, nevertheless, been impressed by the science, by the depth of thought, the documentation, and by the good faith of all of those who have analyzed the great problems which we have tried to solve. I really take away with me a very high es- time for this conference; I don*t regret my long journey, and already I dream of purchasing my ticket for the next international meeting of the Institute throe years hence&#8212;if, of course, the good Good permits mo to live, and I see no special reason why he should not do so. I hope to find again at that time the same faces,, the same assembly, both masculine and feminine; they would not understand that a Frenchman, unless he were very depressed, would miss the opportunity of paying his respects to what we call in French the &quot;weaker sex.&quot; Probably to vindicate our&#172; selves, and because we feel that the intelligence and the heart of woman is in&#172; finitely superior to that of man, we draw up Civil Codes to chain the power of this &quot;weaker sex.&quot; Those are our weapons of Collective Security. We shall have inscribed in the annals of this magnificent and enchanting valley, if not concrete results, at least the strength of a great will in the direction of the preservation of peo.ee in the Pacific area. And so, %ve will not have spoiled the valley by bellicose attitudes, by words of resentment or hostility and the magnificent frame-work of Nature will have merited our respect. This same Nature gives to us a lesson of peace in its very serenity, in its calm, and by its security for these charming animals who live here among the trees without fear, and without apprv&apos;hensiofi .of the Lav/ of the Jungle-~even without fearing man, since it is for&#172; bidden to kill here. YJhat a beautiful thing if the same restraint could be extended one day to the human life and to the life of all the nations! Is all hope forbidden in this respect? Somctines it has occurred to me here in the great tranquility of these beautiful evenings, when the valley is enveloped in shadows and when the soft moon is illuminating the lofty haughtiness of the valley walls themselves in its</essay:p>

            <essay:p>silvery light, and I said to myself that : &quot;Vie too are down in the shadow; wo arc still in the shadow full of fears and menaces where we don&apos;t see clearly, where our prejedices, our instincts, our errors, and our ignorance buffet one another together into a confused scramble which can becomc murderous. But there is a higher light above; it is the light towards which xve should move because of its serenity&#8212;towards its truth, its sweetness, and towards the peace xvhich it showers upon us, when wo shall have the will and the courage to attain the very crest of free reason-Tthe heights where wisdom reigns in a fresh life- giving atmosphere. It is impossible to understand ourselves, to realize that we are all human, to live near each other affectionately and in confidence buffeting against insoluble difficulties? Here again &apos;the lesson of the valley comes to my mind. For the past fourteen days we have lived near one another in a charming international life&#8212; it was a universe in miniature; our different races have mixed easily in cordial relations towards which each one contributed his smiles and the best he could give; we exchanged in a brotherly way the pure water and the tomatoe juice; Americans and Japanese ladies have danced to the same rhythm; Russians and Chinese ladies have shared the pleasures of the same blues; and with jolly enthusiasm the mas&#172; culine and feminine representatives of throe-fourths of the universe have mixed the bubblings of their cheerfulness in the rapprochements of the barbeque. V;&apos;hy not try to carry over into the complex life of the world the spirit which enchanted our cordial little life hero in the valley? It is already such a short life that we have--why put into it the conflicts and miseries of nations? All our people need peace; no one, however heroic, desires deliberately to permit kill&#172; ing or to 3$ill his neighbor. ITar is not the normal state of humanity. Uar doesn&apos;t pay; war is not in itself an ideal. The great efforts of mankind have been strained for centuries and centuries so that the life of our cities might be full of clear 303/ and of happy tasks, and not so that the streets should run rod with blood, be burned by fire or strewn with corpses. Undoubtedly such ^oy is necessary for all, some liberty for all, some justice for all, and some sun for all. Everyone ought to have his place in the sun--we must strive together in a friendly fashion close to one another. What we cannot do, what none of us can do, is to relinquish his place and to re-enter the shadow, taking his flag with him in abdication of his own civilization; for by so doing he would be injuring humanity as much as himself. Our civilizations are not irreconcilable; they are not contradictory; I have never believed, I i\ould never believe in the &quot;inevitable&quot; hostility of the East and the &quot;.Test. I think that to the contrary we can mix the brightness and the beauties of these civilizations, as tho most different flowers combine themselves together to make up the harmony of a splendid garden. May each one of us bring his best seeds for composing the magnificent blossoming of tho garden of peace I In this way we shall be worthy of our title as men. May God help us and bless us, because He wishes peace to all men of good will.</essay:p>

The report which was asked of me is, I think, something in the nature of a resume of the discussions of a round table, &quot;which is in itself, something of a resume of all the preceding round tables, I feel even more this responsibility because my English is rather deficient, and my vocabulary limited, Mark Twain said that he once heard a sermon which he considered excellent. When it was over he went to the preacher and congratulated him upon it. But, he added, that strangely enough, he noticed that all the words of the sermon were in a book he had at home. The clergyman seemed very much concerned. He discussed with Mark Twain at some length the possibilities of plagiarism and unconscious imitation* Twain promised him that he would send him the book he referred to; and on the morrow the clergyman did, in fact, receive a parcel from hLm, He opened it and found it contained the book. The book was a dictionary. Now, I think that personally I have a very groat advantage over this clergyman. You won!t be able to find all my words in the dictionary. The subjects which were discussed in the fifth round table can be, as you know, divided into two parts: The first, which is descriptive - the exposition of the redistribution of power in the Pacific area; and the second, which is constructive, and which, by that fact, has been much more difficult to deal with - the possibilities of the peaceful adjustment of conflicts. In many of the books of political science or economics, the part which concerns the description of facts or the critiques of the policies, is brilliant and accurate. The conclusive part,, which deals with positive proposals, is not as convincing or as sound, The action of the Institute of Pacific Relations, in in&#172; sisting on the discussion of positive readjustments is all the more to be praised, I, Redistribution of Power. 1, Economic Factors As far as the redistribution of power in the Pacific is concerned, there was, I think, a general agreement on the fact that a change of balance of power in this area of the world, had been extremely rapid; a chajigo which was chiefly attributed to two main factors - an economic one and a political or military one. Economically there has first been the intense economic development of some countries: the quick industrial expansion of Japan, and also the rapid economic development of the USSR, especially in Siberia, And there has also to be taken into account, since a very few years, the economic reconstruction of China, But the character itself of the different economic policies, pursued by the various countries of the Pacific also had some effect on the balance of power itself. The policy of the NRA in the United States, or the one of the five year plans in the USSR, contributed to turn the attention of the people of these two</essay:p>

Due partly to strategical, partly to psychological reasons (the desire for isolation on the part of -America, the preference on the part of Great Britain, of social expenditures over military ones), it was recognized in more than one discussion that the two chief countries in the Washington Treaties - the United States and Great Britain - had not maintained the same degree of pre&#172; dominance. The case of the United States was chiefly discussed. Even with the vast increase of its navy, in the last three years, is this country in a position to enforce in the West Pacific its traditional policy of the open door and the integrity of Chine,.? &quot;Which naval base could be used efficiently for such action? Would Guam or Manila be of main importance? Or would the Aleutian Islands be better Opinions amongst American members differed widely on this point. They differed of course still more when it came to the point of comparing the different strengths of the navies and the armies, Japanese military expenditures were said to be very high; but Japanese members declared that the Russian military forces in the Far East &#8226;-.were superior in number to their own. The Russian members, admitted that the doubling of the Trans-Siberian Railway and the development of their heavy industries in Siberia, had much increased their power of resistance in the Far East, The part which might be played in a conflict by the air force remained also a still rather unknown factor, though a British expert declared that in his opinion, the possible action of aircraft in a conflict in the Pacific, would probably not be as important as it is generally thought, or as it would be in other parts of the world, where the distances were not so great, and the necessity of auxiliary boats for carrying the loads not so urgent. In fact, as far as military potentialities are concerned, no one would have expected the round table to clear the facts. An American member said that it would be necessary to have in Yosemito a general staff plus Einstein, to determine the relative forces of the Powers in the Pacific, There was still more discussion when coming to the study of the char&#172; acteristics of the military forces of each nation. Several Japanese members complained of the charge which was made of their forces having an aggrossivo character, saying that it appeared, in fact, that most of the nations considered the forces of their neighbors to be aggressive, and their own to be merely for the purpose of defense, 3, The Washington Treaties, These changes in the balance of power, whatever had been their extent, were asserted, chiefly by the Japanese members, but also by a few others, to be an important factor in the breaking up in the Pacific of the diplomatic machinery, ihe^instance of th&#169;^Washington Treaties was chiefly discussed, and the present period in the Pacific was characterized by an American member as the time of the</essay:p>

            <essay:p>breaking up of tho Washington Treaty. Tho Washington Treaties and especially the Nine Power Pact, did not take into consideration the possible development of Russia which did not attend the conference. The Japanese Government, said a Japanese member, fully adheres today to the Nine Power Pact, But the same member added that it may be a problem, for the maintenance of the future peace of the Pacific, to consider modifications of the Nine Power Pact, in view of the funda&#172; mental changes in conditions in the Pacific, An American member stressed the fact that, in tho opinion of many American jurists, the treaties become obsolete because of changed conditions, only if the negotiators of the treaties contemplated that such changes did render the treaties obsolete; and he insisted on the point that tho existence of a change in cir&#172; cumstance would not give, in any case, a right to unilateral denunciation. It only would give the right to appeal to an International Court for decision. In fact, there wore some divergencies of opinion about the present validity of the Nine Power Treaty, The majority of&apos;-tho members thought that it wb,s still legally valid in the. Pacific *&quot; s\ach were some cf the main remarks which wore made about the changes in the balance of powers in the Pacific, It has been, I think, one of the merits of those who discussed this situation not to try to make it clearer than it was in reality, and not to try to enunciate into simple formulas, trends and potentialitie; which are in themselves rather confused. Possibilities of Readjustment As I said in the beginning, this part of the discussion was chiefly tho descriptive part and also the critical one. The members of the fifth round table then tried to come to more constructive topics. Ideas are like stones - there are two ways of using thorn: either to throw them at one another or to use them to build something with, I am not sure the members of the round table never proceeded in the first way. The contrary would have been monotonous. But thoy tried to follow chiefly the second method, 1, Economic Possibilities, (a) Raw Materials Amongst the possibilities of peaceful adjustment which were put forward, some were of an economic character, some of a political one. Economically tho problem of guaranteed access to raw material was generally tho starting point; but as soon as it was discussed, it was found that such a formulation of tho questic did not load very far. Access to raw material is nearly always guaranteed in time of peace. Even restriction schemes do not prevent access to raw materials, Tho question of acccss is chiefly important in time of war. It becomes then mainly a political question, and a question of communications. More definite appeared to be the problem, which is rather different, of the control of the production of raw material, control which, when it is financial, might have some economic advantages, as far as the balance of payment of the country is concerned, and when it is political, has chiefly military advantages. One Russian member emphatically declared that the cause of the acutsnoss of the problem of raw material lies in the fact of the military policies of the nations. The need of raw material, he said, was, generally speaking, not the cause of an aggression but, on the contrary, it was the desire for aggression which was the cause for wanting raw material control*</essay:p>

            <essay:p>In conclusion, it was felt necessary to say more specifically, instead of &quot;access to raw material,&quot; &quot;access to raw material with easy purchase.&quot; Several members, including Japanese, indeed admitted that the main aspect of the problem of raw materials was how to acquire the means of purchasing them* Two means were chiefly discussed: (b) Export Trade First, the development of export trade. But of course when it came to the practical ways of developing this trade, opinions began to differ -widely. A return to free trade was judged by many as highly desirable, and belong&#172; ing to a past time of happy memory. But the question of the choice between dif&#172; ferent evils, that is, between methods of protection, was discussed at a greater length. Though there was no general consensus on the point, it might be seen from the records, that the members in favor of quotas were more numerous than those in favor of tariffs, Vvhile it was noted that in practice these two forms of pro&#172; tection are simultaneous, quotas were said by many to be mofe flexible, and es&#172; pecially was it admitted that by allowing the nations to come to a clearer view of their needs, they were preparing better the way towards international economic adjustments&#169; As far as these international economic agreements were concerned, though multi-lateral agreements were generally thought theoretically better, bilateral ones were judged by many members the best way at present of breaking through trade barriers of the world. The value of an unconditional most-favored-nation clause, which r^ight give to bilateral trade agreements a greater international value was much questioned, due chiefly to the fact that it was evaded by quotas or by some subterfuge in the defining of goods. It was also suggested that, together with the negotiation of bilateral agreements, a meeting of an economic conference would help for the general planning of world economy. (c) Money Lending, But another method of developing the means of purchasing the raw materials was discussed to some extent: the revival of foreign lending. It was suggested that if the American people would utilize their reserves of gold and consent to lend again, it would tremendously help world trade. Two difficulties, chiefly of psychological character, were stressed by American members, the first one due to the borrowers themselves, who generally want the money but are not eager to accept any form of control; and the second one due to the lender, who had become nowadays not too confident, Much money had been frozen iri the world; and the word &quot;frozen&quot; is, as everybody knows, an academic term to express a practice which has become very popular indeed in the world, A suggestion was made by a British member that it would be necessary to offer an international guarantee to lenders. But, unhappily enough, the proposal was not carried further* 2. Political or Juridical Readjustments If, in the coarse of the first four round tables, economic developments occurring in the Pacific were discussed at greater length, in the last round table, as far as possibilites of readjustments were concerned, the discussion of political or juridical plans was chiefly insisted upon.

(l) Particular agreements In the first category wore discussed some proposals of bilateral agreement.&apos; (a) Russia-Japan A Japanese member emphasized the fact that, though it was always necessary to have a broad scheme of machinery, in the main, it is also indispensable to pay &#9632; attention to those narrow bilateral arrangements for solving disputes* The possibility of such agreements between Russian -and Japanese, and on the other hand between Chinese and Japanese, was envisaged# With regard to tho relations between Russia and Japan, it appeared that many of the members of the round table we re finding a pact of non-aggression be&#172; tween the two countries highly desirable. On one hand, Russia had changed, its policy of concluding non-aggrossion pacts with its neighbors. On the other hand, one Japanese member said that, with regard to Russia, he vdshed that tho two countries would dispose of their disputes in a peaceful way; that fisheries and border disagreements could, in fact, bo settled in such a manner; some important diplomatic personages in Japan were, In fact, favoring such a pact. The presence of a huge Russian army in the Far East was, in his opinion, the most important factor which was bringing suspicion in Japanese minds. (b) China-Japan The problem of the rapprochement between China and Japan appeared to be more complex. Though both the Chinese and the Japanese expressed the wish for a friendly settlement of all questions outstanding between tho two peoples, it was seen that many difficulties still lie in the path loading toward such a result. One of the conditions which seemed to some of the Japanese members preliminary to such an agreement, was the Chinese obligation to prevent subversive anti-Japanese propaganda. But the main point at issue appeared to be on what situations was such an agreement to be drawn up. A Chinese member said that tho withdrawal of Japanese political and military operati ns in China proper and Inner Mongolia would be a prerequisite. Ho also asserted that the principle of non-recognition seemed to him to be one of the only principles still in effect in the Far East, vfhile a Japanese member em&#172; phasized, that if China still does not recognize the fact that Manchoukuo has been established, there is no possibility of peaceful settlement of the Sino-Japanese dispute. An essential condition to such an arrangement between China and Japan was also,in the opinion of many of tho Chinese members, that any treaty between tho two countries ought to bo in an international framework, which would include also the U.S.A., the USSR and Great Britain.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>(c) General Pact The discussion of a possible agreement between Japan and China was then directed towards the study of a more general pact. The possibility of such a now pact was discussed in each of the round tables^ i A Chinese member proposed a reiteration of the Nine Power Pact. Some members suggested that the USSR might bo invited to sign such a pact&#174; Most of the members agreed on the fact, that in any case, periodic conferences of Pacific Powers should be hold, and some proposed that before any Pacific Power took any important stop in the Pacific, it should consult with the other states at a con&#172; ference of Ambassadors. The most modest type of consultations seemed to many members better than nothing. However, the type of pacts without teeth seemed to some members, to be of a rather inefficient type, and together with the possibility of consultative pacts or bilateral agreements, there was discussed inthe round tables, the more ambitious question of collective security&#174; (2) Collective Security (a) Collective Security and Poacoful Change. The nature of collective security itself was questioned by some members. They seemed to fear that there was, in fact, an opposition between the idea of collective security as it is understood today, and the need of peaceful change^ Several Japanese emphasized the fact that some nations ought not to regard collect&#172; ive security as an attempt to maintain status quo at the expense of proletarian nations, but that it ought to be an attempt to build a really secure peace. But it was felt by many of the members, that there was no contradiction between collective security and peaceful change. One of them, a Russian ono, ex&#172; pressed, however, the idea that the words &quot;peaceful chango&quot; were themselves not always clear enough. He admitted that there must be changes in political situa&#172; tions as they are in nature; but that two conditions ought to limit peaceful change. First of all, force ought not to be considered as a main factor in the poaceful change; and secondly, peaceful change ought not to recognize the changes made by force in the past. Otherwise this change would begin with a provocation &#8226;^0 aggression. Peaceful change in his opinion, needs some previous requisite; and this previous requisite is the adoption of collective security. He proposed a new form of safeguarding peace which would bo acceptable to all nations - the meeting of an international permanent conforence of peace, &quot;It is better, he said, &quot;to use a peace conference before a war has begun than after,&quot; (b) Collective Security Pacts, With such a clarification in mind, it appeared to most of the members, that the establishment of an effective system of Collective Security in the Pacific would be highly desirable; but opinion began to diverge to a considerable extent, when the question of the possibility of such machinery was considered. A Canadian member emphasized the fact that Collective Security supposed no reservation on national honour nor indeed on vital interests. In his opinion, the nations which were not prepared to accept such conditions, would do better by not becoming party to such a pact. In fact the warmest advocates of Collective Security, and notably a French member, asserted that there ought to be some differentiation, in the framing of Collective Security, between the obligations of the different nations. Any general scheme ofCollectivc Security, such as the Covenant of the League 01</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Vital interests The third difficulty arose from the fact that some of the members put forward the question of the vital interests of nations# A Japanese member stated that xvhen a question of policy vital to Japan1s existence and growth, qomos^up, Japan, as, in his opinion, other nations, would be loath to have things decided by the counting o-f heads# No government in the world, ho said, would consent to leave the destiny of its own people to a body of outsiders; all countries, in his opinion, allowed only matters of comparatively minor importance to go before the permanent court, or a body consisting of a third person# While this opinion was opposed by some members, the fact that such on idea might&apos; be prevailing in some countries, was considered in itself, to be a hindrance to the establishment of Collective Security# Such were some of the ideas which were brought out during the discussions, and the main proposals made for peaceful adjustment in regard to political pro&#172; blems. It could not be hoped that any of the solutions proposed would find un&#172; animous support. But, as one of the Chairmen of the Round Tables pointed out, the Institute of Pacific Relations is net a gathering of diplomats. The main purpose of the discussions of the Round Tables had been attained to a large extent, if the implications of each of the main solutions proposed had been clearly realized; if the contact between the different groups of people had con&#172; tributed to make each point of view easier to understand; and helped to the growth of a psychology, if not of collective security, at least of better collect&#172; ive understanding#</essay:p>
