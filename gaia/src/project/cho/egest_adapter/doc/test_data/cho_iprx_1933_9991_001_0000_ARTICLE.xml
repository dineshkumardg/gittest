            <essay:p>A GUIDE TO THE BANFF DISCUSSIONS FOREWORD The purpose of this paper is to restate for the benefit of those who will attend the Fifth Conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations to be held at Banff August 14 to 28s 1933, and particularly for those who will on that occasion participate in the Institute&apos;s activities for the first time, the purposes, characteristics and methods of the Institute. It is also the intention of this paper to focus these general remarks upon the subjects to be discussed at Banff so as to furnish not only an intro&#172; duction to the Institute but also to the particular topics to be considered at the forthcoming Conference. I. INTRODUCTION The agenda for the Banff Conference was, in its main outline and points of emphasis, determined at the close of the Shanghai Conference held in the autumn of 1931. Each National Council thereupon set about the task of preparing the papers necessary to document the discussions of these sub&#172; jects, and, concurrently, each Council and members of the International Secretariat and Program Committee began to refine and develop the agenda. Developments along both lines, data paper preparation and discussion agenda, may be traced through successive reports and announcements issued by the Central Secretariat during this biennial period. The implications and purposes of the selection of the particular sub&#172; jects contained in the Banff agenda cannot be understood in the light merely of the period subsequent to the Shanghai Conference (1931). The Institute does not carry on its activities by two-year periods; it does not jump suddenly from one area of concentration, either geographically or topically, to another in each biennium. On the contrary, there has been marked continuity in the pursuit of its researches, studies and discussions. The deliberations of one Conference have determined the subjects to be discussed at the next. The findings of research have pointed to the necessity for further investigations. Conferences and research, moreover, have mutually influenced the subsequent program of the other. There has been, in short, a consistent and continuous search for comprehension of the affairs of the Pacific area. In consequence, the discussions at Banff must be viewed on a back&#172; ground, not merely of the months which have elapsed since the close of the Shanghai Conference, but on a background of the eight years since the organization of the Institute in 1925. It is of special importance that the realms to be explored at Banff be described in the total perspective of the Institute&apos;s activities because of the different personnel invited to each Conference. There will be at Banff a large number of individuals who have never before participated in an Institute Conference and who have had only casual contact with the organization&apos;s work in past years. A changing personnel at each Conference is regarded as essential in order constantly to bring new minds and new experiences to bear on the problems of the Pacific area, but if this resulted in repetition of similar discussions</essay:p>

            <essay:p>every two years it would hardly fulfill the purposes of the organization. The institute has the more difficult task of drawing together new individuals to proceed not from the point of departure of the first Conference in 1925, but from the point reached after an accumulation of years of study and thought&#8226; II. AEEAS OF CONCENTRATION Certain characteristics of Institute Conferences have repeatedly re&#172; vealed themselves. Mention of them may serve the twofold purpose of suggest&#172; ing: the objectives and methods of the Institute and especially of the Banff Conference and of introducing the subjects selected for this year&apos;s considera&#172; tion. In describing these characteristics it may, first of all, be useful to locate the areas of thought and matter in which Institute discussions are concerned. a. Areas of Conflict Conferences have always concentrated on areas of conflict. Whether in the highly charged fields of political controversy or in the ^eos &#171;mo*x&#171;a- al, but nevertheless troublesome, region of economic conflict the discussions It&#8482; invariably invaded dangerous territory. This has not amen as h re&#172; sult of an excited pursuit of the &quot;hot spots&quot; of international relations, but from the assumption that controversial areas require most study and that they serve, moreover, as the most practical entering wedge to a comprehension of the more normal behavior among nations. From this emphasis on controversial matters, the danger of distor- tion, that is of undue emphasis on conflict itself, has always been present. If all the affairs of the Pacific area were in some miraculous way tabulated it would undoubtedly be found that both from quantitative and qualitative points of view far more of these affairs proceeded normally and peacefully than in an irregular or antagonistic manner. It would be found that the broad pattern of international relations forms a coherent and correlated design marked by the unfortunate execution of certain details. But just as in this figure of a vast design, so in the actual political, social, ana economic relations of the area the errors in detail may, and often do, destroy the effect of a sound structure. Concentration on areas of conflict may bring distortion from another point of view. Attention may be so attracted by these areas that it will dwell too much on the details of the conflict itself, and too little on the origins which usually lie elsewhere - in organisations, customs, or policies initiated thousands of miles away and in categories of thought far removed from the current manifestation of conflict. The Institute Conferences, then, by concentrating on areas of con&#172; flict run into these dangers of distortion. The point is here recorded so that by calling it to the attention of those who will participate m tne Banff discussions the correct perspective may be retained.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>b. International Affairs of the Pacifio The Institute focuses its attention in two further directions. Geographically it limits its scope to the Pacific area, and within that area to international rather than domestic affairs. Both restrictions how&#172; ever must be qualified&#8226; From many points of view the Pacific area is a false category; it is not capable of being isolated from the rest of the world. It is self-sufficient neither with respect to food, raw materials, trade, capital, ideas, or policies. An attempt to discuss any of the af&#172; fairs of the area as though they were wholly peculiar to it would be a serious falsification of reality. The Institute, in its deliberations, consequently, emphasizes the area without regarding it as exclusive. The discussion at Banff, for instance, will be documented by illustrations drawn entirely from the Pacific, but the discussions themselves will doubtless lead to numerous world-wide implications of Pacific problems. No more successfully can international affairs be divorced from the domestic conditions out of which they arose. Although emphasis may be placed on the external relations of nations, and the understanding of these affairs may be the Institute*s primary endeavor, oftentimes they have no reality in themselves and cannot be comprehended except on the background of the internal affairs of which they are merely an external manifestation. It is to be anticipated, therefore, that at Banff, as at Shanghai, Kyoto and Honolulu, the discussions will frequently lead back to domestic conditions in order that the international aspects of the matter under consideration may be understood. o&#187; Area of the Social Sciences The concern of the Institute lies, moreover, within the area of human relations. But within these limits it is no more possible to isolate economics from sociology or sociology from political science than it is, as we have seen, to separate the international from the domestic aspects of questions or the Pacific area from the rest of the world. Once more, the Institute merely shifts emphasis from one Conference to another. At Banff, the agenda calls primarily for a discussion of economic matters, but the fact that the agenda also provides for a consideration of the political and educational problems arising out of the economic is recognition of the fact that in practical affairs the disciplines merge imperceptibly into one an&#172; other. Matters of trade lead back to industrialization; industrialization leads back to wages, trade unions, standard of living, labor supply.^ These, in turn, lead to government policy, to custom, tradition, to the heritage of a people. Social organization is a factor in trade just as surely as the relation of food supply to population or the extent of mineral resources* While at Banff emphasis will be placed on the more purely economic factors; it is to be expected that the term &quot;economic&quot; will be most liberally con&#172; strued.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>d. Technique of Unofficial Discussion The discussion technique practiced by the Institute will be expounded in another document to be issued by the Central Secretariat especially for the guidance of round table chairmen. Certain general characteristics^will be mentioned here in order to complete this attempt to orient from various points of view the Institute&apos;s Conference. The phrase &quot;discussion technique&quot; is used advisedly. The round tables organized by the Institute are not haphazard gatherings of individuals of diverse experience assembled to dis&#172; cuss a vaguely-phrased problem of the moment in whatever fashion may appeal to the participants. They are on the contrary carefully planned discussions of subjects arising logically out of a coherent long-term scheme of study, each one of whioh is as accurately and fully documented as possible, in which the participants are selected for qualifications of expertness, experi&#172; ence or representative character, and during the conduct of which a^ scienti&#172; fically determined procedure of discussion is employed. The essential pur&#172; pose of the round table is the comprehension by analysis of the matter at hand and the thorough exploration of the possibilities of resolving the problem through the concentrated effort of many minds experienced in differ&#172; ent activities and conditioned in diverse environments. This purpose implies a discussion that develops; it denies the constant reiteration of points of view already expressed and either recorded or discarded; it precludes the procedure of debate whereby opinions are defended on the basis of a prior judgment irrespective of new evidence introduced during the session. It implies a continual change of mind on the part of each participant as the fusion of experiences develops the question under consideration. In order to avoid the&quot;awkward situation wherein an individual who commands wide public attention finds it necessary to &quot;stand pat&quot; on a much publicized position, no publicity is given individuals during their participation m round table discussions. The method is reliable insurance against the pos&#172; sibility of participants giving or taking offense. The dispassionate and objective atmosphere of a round table is an environment unfavorable to the breeding of ill-feeling. By its unofficial nature, furthermore, the Institute is able to avoid the handicaps and &quot;red-tape&quot; of officialdom. Individuals participate in these Conferences; industries, corporations, organizations, and governments do not. The fact that the Institute is composed of national and territorial units is a matter of expediency; it is not a provision for national or group representation at Conferences. For administrative purposes the basic unit of&quot;the Institute is a national council, although this unit does not in every case correspond to a nationally sovereign unit in the political sense. In fact, the constitution of the Institute expressly provides for the organiza&#172; tion of councils in regions having a certain degree of racial or territorial independence from their sovereign states &#8212; the Philippines being a case in point. The geographical unit, moreover, is the most suitable one for^the administration of research and for carrying out the educational functions oi the Institute. The fact that this organizational unit has persisted in con&#172; nection with Conferences, to which members from the same area are naturally likely to travel together, and during which each unit is likely to hold fre&#172; quent meetings for administrative purposes, has led to some confusion as to the purpose of this unit. There has been a tendency, quite contrary to the methods of the Institute, for certain groups to use the administrative unit^ to formulate and advocate group opinions on matters under discussion. inis</essay:p>

            <essay:p>has resulted not only in hampering the development of the Institute&apos;s technique of discussion by forming national blocs, but also in placing the members of such groups in an entirely different relation to the dis&#172; cussions from the members of other groups participating solely in their individual capacities. It is hoped that at Banff this tendency will be checked, if the practice is not altogether discarded, and that every group will limit its group functions to administrative and informational matters. &quot;While its non-representative character prevents the Institute from speaking with official authority, it enables it to speak with the authority of unbiased information. The Institute is not engaged in seeking patch&#172; work remedies for international maladjustments; it is not concerned with immediate results and therefore by its own constitution prohibits the pass&#172; ing of resolutions or the making of recommendations in the field of public affairs by the organization as such. It is engaged, rather, in the long- term work of searching for patterns of relationships in the Pacific area and in disseminating what knowledge it unearths as widely as possible. What the Institute loses in academic remoteness from immediate burning issues, it gains by a more basic and consequently sounder method of procedure, III. TRENDS OF INSTITUTE CONFERENCES The foregoing are certain of the characteristics of Institute Confer&#172; ences which serve to locate the place of its discussions in contemporary affairs and in the international methods of instruments for dealing with them. It may next be profitable to introduce the forthcoming discussions with further remarks designed to indicate the trends of Institute Conferences, trends culminating in the agenda outlined for Banff. Broadly, the discernible trends in the Conferences have been these: (l) from undocumented discussion to discussion fully supported by long-term research and briefs especially pre&#172; pared for the particular disoussion; (2) from the more cultural aspects of international relations and therefore from those less susceptible to scientific study to the more economic and analyzable aspects; (3) from a concentration on the affairs of the Far East and especially China to an emphasis on problems underlying the affairs of the whole Pacific area; (4) from emotionally-charged and disputable categories, such as, sovereignty, nationality, rights, duties, obligations, or &quot;face,&quot; to the more fundamental and real categories of trade, finance, education, standard of living, or in&#172; dustrialization; and, lastly, (5) from a consideration of the purely external affairs of nations to the total domestic and foreign situation of which external activities are merely a part. Each of these trends will be briefly discussed. a. Towards Fully Documental Discussion The first Conference, held in Honolulu in 1925, in round tables and public forums undertook to consider a wide range of topics from national points of view towards Pacific problems to the effects of industrialization and the export of capital. Most time, however, was devoted to migrations and the missionary movement. It was found that accurate information ms lacking, thereby greatly handicapping the possibilities of intelligent discussion.

            <essay:p>of opinions rather than of the facts from whioh opinions could be formulated^ It is to the credit of those who participated in this initial Conference and in the subsequent one held in 1927 that this lack was recognized and that plans were laid for a program of long-term research to be conducted under^ the auspices of national research committees coordinated with an internation&#172; al research oommittee administered by the Central Secretariat. From this point forward a well-planned program of research was undertaken, itself providing substantial documentation for subsequent Conferences and indirect&#172; ly furnishing important sources of information for the data papers or briefs prepared especially for each Conference. The development of the Institute&apos;s program of research will be con&#172; sidered in a separate report and it is necessary in the present document only to call attention to the trend in the relation of research to the Con&#172; ferences and particularly to the Banff discussions. The tendency to docu&#172; ment the Conferences more and more adequately has made it possible this year to expect the fulfillment of two desiderata: first, that each major subject of discussion will be adequately supported by data drawn from each of the areas in which the Institute has organized groups; and, second, that data from each area will be comparable to those from each other area. An unfortunate by-product of this trend has been the ever growing volume of material presented to Conference members shortly before the open&#172; ing of the first session, a mass too great to digest in a short space of^ time, especially inasmuch as that period is taken up with other matters in&#172; cident to the Conference. The Institute has attempted to overcome this in two ways. The first, and most obvious, has been to lengthen the period dur&#172; ing which documents may be studied by endeavoring to issue the papers well in advance. Administrative obstacles have heretofore prevented the realiza&#172; tion of this objective, although a decided improvement in this direction is anticipated for Banff. The second method has been the preparation of syllabi which serve as summaries of what is more elaborately contained in the numer&#172; ous data papers. It is intended for Banff that these syllabi, in addition to providing summaries such as those presented for the Shanghai Conference, shall provide guides or indexes to the Conference documentation with topical page references. A further measure is planned for the forthcoming meeting in the form of numerous wall maps and charts for the purpose of illustrating visually the data contained in the documents. Not only, therefore, may the discussions be expected to be more adequately documented than before, but several methods will be further developed whereby the data may be more readily utilized. b&#187; Towards Economic Questions A trend away from the more cultural and towards the more economic aspects of questions has been noted. Two factors, perhaps, account for this shift in emphasis. In spite of the active participation of experts on the cultures of the different civilizations involved, there has been a conspicuous lack of success in analyzing these cultural elements in a way suitable for either research or discussion. Cultural factors have remained elusive, protected by a vagueness that has so far defied attempts to break down the larger cefcegory into the elements which compose it. On the other hand, the more sociological and the more economic aspects of the relations</essay:p>

            <essay:p>of the people of the Pacific have more easily succumbed to scientific in&#172; vestigation. Wliereas such a topic as the Maohine Age and Traditional Cul&#172; ture, which was essayed at the Kyoto Conference, remained baffling, a topic such as Industrialization in the Pacifio Area has been subjected to statis&#172; tical analysis in a dozen forms and the sub-categories readily ascertained by experts. A counter tendency is at present apparent in the desire ex&#172; pressed by several groups, that at the 1935 Conference the emphasis be shifted away from the economic conditions at present under consideration to matters of education. It is to be hoped that if this counter tendency is realized an entering wedge will successfully have been made to the analysis of cultural problems. In approaching cultural matters the Institute may have relied too much on persons merely having familiarity with traditional culture but lacking scientific training in the analysis of culture. A number of scientifically trained persons, associated with the Institute, are now directing their attention to the dissection of cultural matters for purposes of research and discussion. This effort, coupled with the interest in educa&#172; tion noted above, promises to place these heretofore elusive problems on a footing with the more materialistic aspects of the affairs of the Pacific. The movement towards eoonomic questions has a more fundamental ex&#172; planation in contemporary affairs. Successive post-war crises, not only in Europe but also in the Far East, although often political in their superficial aspects, have been primarily of an eoonomic nature. Security, that all- inclusive category so prominent in current international jargon, is essential&#172; ly oomposed of a number of economic factors &#8212; whether in France or Japan. The modern form of the Monroe Doctrine just as much as Japan&apos;s Right to Live Dootrine is made up of elements primarily economic. The current world-wide economic crisis, announced by the New York stock market crash just as the Kyoto Conference was beginning, reinforced this tendency in the Institute&apos;s activities $ and the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, which began just before the Shanghai discussions, furthered the movement. The mandate, indeed, for the Banff agenda is given by the recurrent and intense international conflict in the last two decades whioh, though political in form, has been economic in content. o. Towards Wider Geographical Area &quot;&#8212; &quot; &#9632; .&apos;&#9632; &apos; ii i. &apos;i &#9632;&#9632;..... ......... ............I..I. A third trend has been noted, from concentration on the affairs of the Far East to a wider geographical area. Much of the conflict in this part of the world has apparently been centered in China, and more particularly in China&apos;s treaty ports and foreign settlements and in Manchuria &#8212; in places, in other words, where the dynamic expansionism of modern economic countries met China&apos;s ancient methods and forms of society and economy. Whether over the rights of extraterritoriality and the attendent problems of administering justic&#171;# over thm ganotity and validity of treaties, over the operation of foreign&#187;finanoed railways, or over the official attitude towards missionary schools, most of th* irritating matters seemed concentrated on Chinese soil. In consequence of this apparent fact the first three, and even four, Confer&#172; ences devoted special attention to a searching examination of China. The superficiality of this view became evident only when experience had demonstrated the importance of investigating deeper than the surface mani&#172; festations of conflict. It then appeared that the extraterritorial privileges and the social, legal and economic obstacles under which foreigners operated</essay:p>

            <essay:p>in China were no different in kind, but only different in degree, from the status of aliens in any country. The problem of aliens was thereafter view&#172; ed as one common to all the countries of the Pacific, a problem acute in the United States in the period around 1924 and acute in China, for quite other reasons, over the entire decade0 Nor, has it appeared, could the problem involved in the importation of large quantities of foreign capital by China be approached without reference to somewhat analagous situations prevailing at different periods in the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia. If for no other reason than better to understand affairs in China, therefore, the Institute would have been obliged to consider a wider area. The basio problems of the Pacific area cannot be explored success&#172; fully in a single nation. In order to comprehend the modern phenomenon of expansionism from more to less highly organized economic areas, all of its ascertainable characteristics must be studied. The phenomenon manifests it&#172; self quite otherwise in Indo-China than it does in Hawaii, or as carried on by the Germans in China in contrast to the methods employed there by the Japanesec Although the effects of expansionism vary greatly, the process seems to have elements in common regardless of the impelling force behind it. It is by means of the export of manufactured goods and capital and entire industries, and the import of raw and semi-manufactured materials and the accompanying phenomena of struggle for the control of communications, tariffs, exchange restrictions, and immigration legislation &#8212; a complex process which we have called expansionism &#8212; that different nations come . into contact. It is this whole process which the Banff Conference intends to explore. Behind the dynamics of expansionism is the organization of society, or the method of economy, we term capitalism; before it is the semi- feudal or semi-primitive organization of colonial or otherwise dominated territoriesc A study of the process, itself, of expansionism premises an analysis of its areas of origin and destination as well. And thus it is, that, coincident&apos;with a shift to the more economic aspects of the affairs of the Pacific area, there is a corresponding shift to a more inclusive geo&#172; graphical base. The analysis of the causes of and remedies for the world-wide economic depression support this trend to a wider area of concentration. Almost simultaneously, in every important country in the world, with the exception of the U.SoSoR.* indexes of economic welfare tumbled to unpre&#172; cedented lows. There are those who attribute to international factors first place in causing the orash, and who see in the correction of these external factors the appropriate remedies* Others have discerned a parallel disinte&#172; gration of various highly organized domestic economies towards the breakdown of which international factors were only an accompanying incident. To persons holding the latter view corrections must first be applied to internal condi&#172; tions and only secondarily to international ones. Regardless of which of these positions, or the countless intermediate ones, is adhered to, it is patent that the crisis must be studied with reference to a large area and with reference to both domestic and international factors within it, rather than in a single country. In describing this trend, the term &quot;Pacific Area&quot; has been used loosely. The Pacific Ocean extends from the Bering Sea to the waters of the South Pole:</essay:p>

            <essay:p>bordered on the West by Siberia, the Japanese Empire, China, Australia, and New Zealand; and on the East by Alaska, Canada, the United States, Mexico, Central America, and the western countries of South America; and containing the large island groups&apos;of Polynesia, Micronesia.-, Melanesia, and Indonesia. The Institute has never, and is not yeti? concerned with a large section of the eastern boundary of the ocean. To date neither Alaska, Mexico, Central or South America has been prominent in its studies or discussions. These large areas have not applied for membership because, comparatively, they do not figure in the international affairs of the Pacific to the extent that do the regions included in the Institute&apos;s present scope. It has been felt that the growth of the organization should proceed from a nucleus of the regions and powers figuring most prominently in the Pacific and that areas on the fringe of these affairs should only gradually be absorbed. Thus it was not until the 1929 Conference that the islands of the southern Pacific were brought into the Institute&apos;s field of research, and it was only two years ago that contact was definitely established with groups in the U.S.S.R. It may be anticipated that because of the growing economic relations of Japan with nations of South America, the Institute may soon endeavor to form cor&#172; responding groups there. It may also hapoen that the relations between Mexico and the United States and the Orient will become of sufficient concern to the area as a whole to point out the wisdom of drawing that region into the Institute&apos;s view. For the present, however, the countries mentioned are on the periphery of the &quot;Pacific Area&quot; as the term is broadly used in this paper. d. Towards Real Categories The approach to international problems by way of the complex of realities which compose them rather than by way of the generalities whioh serve to keep their true nature hidden, has been suggested as a further trend in the Institute&apos;s work. Viewed in one way, the question of extra&#172; territoriality in China is a problem of constant irritation in which matters of prestige, honor, so-called racial and national characteristics, odious comparisons of superiority and inferiority, and similar vague concepts dis&#172; tort the true picture. In actuality, the system of extraterritoriality is for the most part concerned with strictly defineable commercial and legal matters somewhat colored one way or another by a shifting political scene. If a discussion approaches the problem through the political end, one may confidently predict that it will exaggerate all the emotional prejudices of the participants and become hopelessly involved in a maze of meaningless^ generalities. If, on the other hand, the approach is through the realities of discernable economic and sociological factors, the main substance of extra&#172; territoriality will have been comprehended before the more difficult and delicate political fringe of the system is reached. On the basis of a com&#172; prehension of the core of the problem, it is reasonable to expect a more successful dissection of the periphery. The point is well illustrated by the Institute&apos;s experience with the problems of Manchuria. It would be an unwarranted claim to assert that the Institute has materially altered the affairs of that area one way or another. With respect to immediate events the Institute&apos;s part in affecting their^ course could be discerned only with a microscope. But this is not to maintain that by long attention the Institute has not developed a sound and practical</essay:p>

            <essay:p>method of approaching the troublesome problems of Manchuria; or that in the course of learning this method it has not produced studies and held discus&#172; sions which may in the long run prove influential; or that its members who have participated in this work have not gained considerable insight into the nature of these problems* The Institute has learned this much: that the Manchurian question cannot be approached as such, that it must be broken up into its component parts: that these parts are not fundamentally questions of doctrines or rights or duties, nor questions of treaties or sovereignty, nor liberalism versus oonservatism versus radicalism; that essentially the Manchurian question is composed of realities lying behind policies, treaties, or eoonomic or political creeds &#8212; realities such as the relation of popula&#172; tion to arable land and food supply, the relation of industrialization to sources of raw materials and fuels and markets, and the allied matters of tariffs, monetary and credit systems, exchange, the standard of living in relation to the distribution of wealth, minority factions and general wel&#172; fare, communications via water, air, or land, and a host of comparable factors. It is not claimed that the Institute is alone in developing this method of approach to otherwise&apos;baffling international difficulties. Certain phases of the work of the League of Nations have broken ground towards the same objective. It is pertinent to note how closely the topics of the special studies made by the staff associated with the Lytton Commission of Inquiry parallels the categories under which the Institute has been studying the same problems. The special studies of experts of the Commission were: Memorandum on Railway Questions; What is the Economic Importance of Manchuria for Japan?; Chinese Migration to Manchuria; Memorandum on Public Finance in Manchuria Prior to and&apos;after September 18, 1931; The Currencies of the Northeastern Provinces, with a Supplement on the Central Bank of Manchukuo; Manchuria&apos;s Trade with China Proper and with Foreign Countries; Chinese, Japanese and Other Foreign Investments in Manchuria; Memorandum on Boycotts and Japanese Interests in China; Korean Problems in Manchuria as Factors in the Sino-Japanese Dispute. A glance at the Institute&apos;s list of published studies on Manchuria will indicate the common recognition on the part of these two bodies of the realities of the situation. To close students of international affairs these remarks may be com&#172; monplace. It is necessary therefore, to point out that in the main the oonduct of international relations is seldom conducted by close students of international affairs. Qualified persons have eloquently pleaded that the League Council and Assembly approach the Manchurian conflict by the same method as its own Commission did and in the way developed over several years by the Institute of Pacific Relations. They have pointed out that despite the experiences of these groups, the League&apos;s deliberative bodies haye per&#172; sisted in entering into the controversy by way of concepts of sovereignty and &quot;face&quot;. And it can be maintained that the latter is the usual approach. It is the approach too often employed in schools, universities and associa&#172; tions for adult education or public information* It may be recorded parenthetically that it is the approach so far employed by the Institute it&#172; self in the study of cultural relations, and it seems likely that until the Institute considers the larger category in terms of the many real categories that make it up, substantial success will not be attained.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Towards Comprehensive Point of &quot;View There remains to be described one more trend: from a consideration of the purely external affairs of nations to their total domestic and foreign&quot;activity in which the latter plays the less important role. The relevance of certain domestic factors, such as the relation of food supply, population and land utilization, and population policies to &#163;&#163;&#187;*J&#8482;b affairs has been recognized from the beginning of the Institute&apos;s activities. Land utilization was made one of the first subjects of long-term investiga&#172; tion by the International Research Committee and allied subjects of iood and population were discussed in the early Conferences. A trend, however, has been noticeable in the realization of the fundamental unity of all human activity and the recognition of the fact that no problem ^ inter&#172; national relations can be divorced from the domestic situations which gave rise to it. While there remains considerable room for theoretical dispute as to the relative weight of international and domestic factors in the determination of any given episode and in regard to the order of Parity to be assigned the more materialistic and the more cultural factors, there can be little disagreement with the statement that, viewed comprehensively, the activities of modern societies originate in several economic and social nuclei which more or less correspond to the political boundaries of coun&#172; tries. From these nuclei, in so far as they are dynamic proceed movements of expansion which meet in the external area of international affairs. The external contact may be of a compensatory or a conflicting nature, but in any case it oan be understood only in the light of the entire situation of which it usually forms the smaller part, and the internal or domestic factors the larger part. The agenda prepared for the Banff Conference is the result of this trend towards recognition of the underlying unity of all activity and ^ important position of domestic factors in determining and conditioning inter&#172; national relations. Whether the discussions will point to a further emphasis on the domestic structure, which forms the core of world affairs, &#171;&apos;&#187;?*&#187;*&#9632; a matter for conjecture. It may be anticipated, however, that they will marK a decisive point in the Institute&apos;s study of the problems of the ^cJf^ area, a point marking a comprehensive approach to the affairs of that region reached through successive years of exploration into fragments. It may further be prophesied that once this point has been reached the fundamental comprehensive view will be retained and future discussions will proceed according to a systematic investigation of certain aspects of the entire problem. IV. BANFF AGENDA The Banff agenda has been throughout this paper described as a cul&#172; mination of eight years of experience in the study of the affairs of the Pacific area through a mutually supporting process of discussion and re&#172; search. In view of the contemplated attendance of many who have had no more than casual contact with the Institute, it was thought useful to pro&#172; duce the Banff Conference by a survey of the characteristics and trends^oi the organization during its brief period of activity. The survey contained in the foregoing pages has repeatedly reached back into the Institute s history to trace developments leading up to the forthcoming discussions.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The subjects to be dealt with at Banff have not been directly considered. On the contrary, the purpose has been to describe the intellectual setting of the Conference, in the attempted fulfillment of which, frequent mention has been made of the subjects suggested in the agenda. The Banff Conference will consider controversial, troublesome fea&#172; tures of economic relations in the Pacific area, and political and educa&#172; tional problems arising out of these economic factors. The discussions will be conducted according to a technique, as yet imperfect, but marking a considerable advance over haphazard methods of debate and without the handicaps of official responsibility. They will be documented by papers prepared especially for the purpose by each of the Instituted National Councils and by syllabi and charts prepared by the Central Secretariat. Por the most part, these documents will be sent to members well in advance of the opening session. The agenda which follows is designed to explore the economic con&#172; tacts which form so much of the main structure of the international rela&#172; tions of the Pacific Area. Upon this structure is a superstructure of political and cultural factors, which for the most part appear to be deter&#172; mined by the economic basis but which in turn condition the operation of economic forces. It is with the origin, nature and results of these economic foroes that the Banff Conference will be concerned. A diagnosis of the af&#172; fairs of the Pacific will be essayed in order to determine the part played by economic factors, the possibility of controlling or eradicating those which produce conflict and of supporting those which make for general wel&#172; fare. The whole subject is viewed, in the following agenda, first, in terms of trends to or away from economic self-sufficiency together with quantita&#172; tive and qualitative evaluations of the trends; second, in relation to the governmental and industrial set-up which, operating upon geographical and social premises, produces economic forces and policies; and, third, with respect to the political and educational implications of the foregoing. 1. ECONOMIC CONFLICT AND CONTROL General Theme: Trends of economic dependence or interdependence in regard to food and population, raw materials, manufactured goods, oapital movements, and means of communication. A. Analysis of the tendencies toward an organized economic self-suffi&#172; ciency in certain Pacific regions and their effect on commercial rela&#172; tions. The discussion of this general question will involve considera&#172; tion of the more specific economic elements which make it up, such as: 1. access to raw materials and markets, 2. commodity trade, 5. movements of capital, 4, tariffs, 5. communications.</essay:p>

(b) to what extent have political (e.g., national) or economic (e.ge, tariff) barriers to trade forced the utilization and arti&#172; ficial stimulation of marginal resources and markets? (o) how far has the process of expansionism justified itself in the economic sense &#8212; e&#8222;g&#171;, the U.S. and the Philippines, France and Indo-China, Great Britain and the Pacific Dominions, Japan and its colonies and areas of special influence?

            <essay:p>ciations, patriotic societies, governmental trade promotion, Otoe, should be considered in the same light, (b) to what extent and in what ways do governments control private enterorises involved in external relations? To what extent and in what ways do these private enterprises in&#172; fluence governments? (c) how have governments and private enterprises planned their external operations? To what extent have these plans been effective in achieving the ends desired? To what extent do these plans represent the aims and interests of the people they directly or indirectly affect? Each of the foregoing subdivisions should be considered with reference to particular nations or groups of nations. C. What proposals can be made for a more harmonious disposition of the resources of the Pacific area or for introducing into the existing methods discussed above improvements in the general interest? The course of the discussion under A and B should determine the topics and course of discussion under C. II. INSTRUMENTS FOR INTERNATIONAL ADJUSTMENT 1, What instruments for international negotiation and consultation and adjustments are necessary to meet Pacific problems? 2. Wherein is existing machinery inadequate for these purposes? 3. Any other points germane to the foregoing, including similar questions which may arise in the course of the discussion. The Secretariat recommends that the foregoing questions would probably be most effectively discussed if timed to come during the second week of the conference after substantial progress had been made with the general economic discussions. It is suggested that whoever is responsible for opening up the discussion of these questions should bear in mind the desirability of exploring, among others, the following questions: (a) To ff*&#8482;&#8482; should domestic policies determining the external ^havior of nat ions be internationally controlled, and by what methods; (b) To what extent should national units be used as the basis for representation in inter&#172; national consultation and action; (c) To what extent is functional responsibility possible and desirable? HI. PROBLEMS OF EDUCATION Some of the educational questions likely to come up during the dis&#172; cussion of the economic and political factors are as follows:-</essay:p>

            <essay:p>In what ways and to what extent are economic maladjustments in the Pacific area aggravated by eduoational systems and methods that fail to take into account both national and international needs? Specifically, (a) how do the school curricula and policies of vocational guidance relate to the economic opportunities of different areas and regions? (b) what relation is there between the national aspirations expressed in educational objectives and the conflicting demands of sectional self-sufficiency on the one hand and of the possibilities of inter&#172; national trade on the other? (c) by what means are traditional skills and social and technical heritages of importance to the livelihood of peoples capable of being preserved, protected, or readapted to present-day require&#172; ments? (d) to what extent do educational systems and methods contribute to raise or stabilize standards of living j and what is the effect of such influences on the interchange of commodities and services? What is the experience with active educational measures for birth control as a means of lessening population pressure? What part does educational effort play in protecting Pacific peoples against the competition of immigrants with lower standards of living? What part does migration, both temporary and permanent, play in the reevaluation of cultural standards; and by what educational or other measures may increased international contact be freed from disruptive effects on the social and economic life of native peoples? What, on the other hand, is the probability that the effect of the present depression in diminishing international contact and exchange will lead to a permanent reorientation of economic effort, and what changes in the educational system are needed: (a) to provide new opportunities for talents denied free access to other countries or regions, (b) to readapt social habits and mores to a more self-centered economic situation? What does a planned economy, whether national or in part inter&#172; nationally cooperative, involve with respect to new educational objectives?</essay:p>

            <essay:p>THE PURPOSE AND CONDUCT OF ROUND TABLES FOREWORD In A Guide to the Banff Discussions the Secretariat has endeavored to describe the purposes and methods of the Institute of Pacific Relations, relating these matters particularly to the forthcoming Banff Conference. An elaboration of a certain part of the Institute&apos;s activities, Conference round tables, is contained in the following pages. The Institute has de&#172; veloped round table discussions as a method especially suited to group study of the comprehensive problems of the Pacific area. In the course of the four preceding Conferences this method has been continually developed so that it may now be regarded as a well-defined technique designed to fulfil desirable aims. This pamphlet is intended primarily for those who will participate in an Institute Conference for the first time at Banff. As indicated by its title, it attempts to reveal what part round table discussions play in the study of the affairs of the Pacific and precisely what the round table method is. Members who have attended previous Conferences are already familiar with much that is contained in the following pages; they are urged, nevertheless, to glance through this recapitulation in order to refresh their memories. I. THE PURPOSE OF ROUND TABLES Round table discussions are the principal mechanism and activity of the biennial Conferences of the Institute of Pacific Relations. The Conferences, however, comprise neither the whole nor the most important part of the Institute&apos;s activities; they are merely one of several steps which cannot be evaluated in terms of relative importance, but all of which taken together aim to fulfil the purpose of the organization. This purpose is described in most general terms in the Institute&apos;s Constitution as the &quot;study of the conditions of the Pacific peoples with a view to the improve&#172; ment of their mutual relations.&quot; It is assumed that through study, and through the implied correlated activity of dispersing the results of study, improvement in the relations of the people of this area will result. In the process of study, round tables play an essential role. The inseparable relation among the Institute&apos;s continuous activities makes it impossible to assign primary importance to any one. In the in&#172; terval between Conferences and during these biennial gatherings, the In&#172; stitute&apos;s researches and the complicated process of spreading the results thus obtained together with other information on the affairs of the Pacific area continue. Both activities in part arise from Conference discussions and in part produce these discussions. The topics for study are often de&#172; fined by Conferences, and, in turn, the subjects for discussion are in large measure determined by previous research. Similarly, the spreading of information is greatly facilitated through, and directed by round table discussions; but this educational work also imparts the data necessary for successful discussion.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>In attempting to state the purpose of the round tables, therefore, this paper cannot ignore the indivisibility of the Institute&apos;s total ac&#172; tivity of which discussion forms but one important segment. Round Tables and the Study of Pacif ic J^eoplej^ A premise to the whole idea of an Institute of Pacific Relations is that accurate information widely disseminated is a prerequisite to intel&#172; ligent activity in the modern world. Acceptance of such a premise implies that this function is not and cannot be better performed by another form of organization. It is not pertinent to the subject of this paper to develop this thought beyond the mere statement that in certain fields of human relations in the Pacific at least the work of nationally oriented governments and private organizations - the latter being often further oriented in the direction of prejudiced interests - needs to be supplemented, and that in other fields of human relations in the Pacific little systematic study is being undertaken except by the Institute. Coordination and Initiation of Research and Education - Study of the^ affairs of the Pacific is a vast undertaking requiring all manner of investi&#172; gations . Specialists are equipped to carry on research in a clearly defined direction. But, in as complicated a field of thought as the relations of the peoples of the Pacific, they are seldom capable either of formulating the problem for research adequately in its relation to other problems or in viewing the significance of their particular field; nor are they to be counted on to correlate and interpret correctly the total results of numerous investi&#172; gations. The research worker in most cases is further limited by the very nature of his profession from estimating the applicability of his findings to the world of practical affairs, in which the current evaluations of truth are woefully modified by the limitations of modern societies. The research specialist, then, takes simply a few steps in a long journey. Other steps, in the Institute&apos;s activities, are covered by experts in the dissemination of information, whether through the agencies of formal education, adult education, or popular education as exemplified by the newspaper and radio. But here, too, the expert in education is helpless without the materials furnished by research; likewise he must not only shape his policies by intimate knowledge of the current attitudes of all types of individuals, but must also test his methods by constant reference to their effects upon the layman. The cooperation of the layman is therefore essential to the success&#172; ful conduct of either research or education, just as the assistance of the research worker and educator is a necessity in the pursuit of business or public affairs. In the ordinary course of events, specialists in these fields cooperate haphazardly, or if not haphazardly, in respect to small fragments of human relations, A function of Institute Conferences is to give opportunity for the mutual consideration of comprehensive problems of the pacific area by individuals otherwise concerned with specialized branches of activity and with restricted subjects of thought. At these Conferences it is expected that the work of each member will be determined and tested in the light of the experiences and attitudes of the others. The result is intended to be clearer comprehension of the problems of the area, and of methods, within the scope of the Institute, of dealing with them.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The Round Table Method of Study - The document entitled A Guide to the Banff Discussions points out that&apos; the Institute&apos;s round tables are care&#172; fully planned gatherings of qualified individuals for the purpose^of con&#172; sidering an agenda according to a scientific technique of discussion. The foregoing general considerations may, therefore, be applied to the round table process. The document just referred to described the Banff agenda as the culmination of many years of Institute activity in the study of Pacific problems, and as emphasizing the international economic relations which appear to be basic in relation to political affairs. The direct object of the round tables will be to progress towards understanding the causes and characteristics of these economic relations and to explore the possibilities of resolving the problems that arise therefrom. The indirect purpose will be to further the processes of research and the spreading of information m the light of this clearer comprehension of the factors involved. In pursuing its immediate purpose, round table procedure calls for three steps, usually to be followed in the order named: first, by drawing out all facts, attitudes, and opinions pertinent to the matter at hand, to locate the problem; second, on the basis of this evidence, to formulate and become more clearly aware of the problem or problems; and, third, to move as far as possible towards a solution. The method of proceeding through these steps is one in which each member of the round table contributes. It is intended that no one play the role of informer and no one that of mere listener. It is assumed that whatever results from a round table will be something quite_different from the ideas of any one participant or small group at the opening of the session - only as the thoughts which finally emerge are the result of many minds are they likely to have general validity. It is an axiom that the process of learning is vivid and lasting to^ an individual only just so far as he has intelligently and actively partici&#172; pated in an experience, and in proportion to the intensity or quality of that participation. A by-product of the Institute&apos;s round ^able method then, is the understanding obtained by the members of the problems which they have been exploring. Such a result is directly proportional to the degree to which participation has been mutual and to which the problem under review has been successfully considered. The extent to which the agenda has been successfully explored, moreover, determines the contribution Conference members make to the problems of research and information and the effectiveness with which they can subsequently forward the organization&apos;s ultimate purpose of developing widespread intelligent public opinion on the affairs of the Pacific. The Improvement of Relations - Improving the relations of Pacific peoples-implies that the study ot&apos; these relations has a defmite.end in view and suggests the possibility of acting upon the findings of study in order to achieve this end. Such an interpretation is correct only within limits which it is rather difficult to define. The very postulate on which the Institute is founded, that widespread information is a</essay:p>

            <essay:p>prerequisite to intelligent action, points to the necessity not only for conducting research but also for disseminating information as widely and effectively as possible. On the other hand, the Institute refrains from performing a legislative function or anything remotely connected with such an immediate or practical activity, and it restrains round tables from passing resolutions or making recommendations in the sphere of public af&#172; fairs. Two questions arise: first, where between these points of merely spreading information and. taking legislative action does the Institute&apos;s function cease; and, second, in these times when immediate solutions must be found for current difficulties, what justification is there for an or&#172; ganization which refuses to affect contemporary affairs to the limit of its influence? Long-Term Considerations - The limits of the Institute&apos;s direct in- volvement in contemporary affairs, or, let us say, in international politics, must be determined by the long-term strategy necessary for the successful pursuit of its aims. The organization has three characteristics which condition its strategy: it is unofficial and cannot therefore act with authority in the political field; it is international and so must take into consideration a vastly more complex set of facts and criteria in determining a wise course of action than do nationally located organizations; it is objective in that it has no predetermined notions except the premise here&#172; tofore mentioned, and in consequence has the entire welfare of the peoples of the Pacific (and by logical extension the peoples of the whole world) to consider in establishing values instead of the specified purposes of organizations with more limited scope and more immediate purposes. These points are illustrated by an example used in a previous essay on the Institute. It was suggested in a paper published in the 1927 volume of the Proceedings that the Conference of that year had possibly erred by moving too near the contemporary political field when it attempted to lay down certain principles which might guide statesmen in reaching sound de&#172; cisions. That Conference discussed, among other subjects, the international implications of the Japanese population problem. Without making any specific recommendation, the members tended to endorse the Japanese contention that other nations should modify their own policies with respect to immigration and trade barriers in order to assist Japan in coping with its rapidly in&#172; creasing population. While this principle may have been theoretically sound, events of the next few years indicated it to be entirely out of line with practical possibilities. Since 1927, rather than provide assis&#172; tance to Japan which was in an obviously difficult predicament, other nations have increased the obstacles to a solution of that problem. There was further an implied theoretical fallacy in that the affirmation of the obligations of other nations in this matter might lead Japanese statesmen to rely too greatly on the possibilities of outside assistance in relieving a problem, the core of which was a matter for domestic measures of population control and distribution. The sound, long-term course for the Institute in this particular question might better have been restricted to a continuous study of the facts of the matter and constant effort to have the significance of the facts grasped by as large a section of the public as possible. It is doubt&#172; ful whether the occasion arises more than rarely when the Institute&apos;s course</essay:p>

            <essay:p>should be nearer the field of action. There are, nevertheless, certain affairs of the Pacific lying well on the periphery of politics where the indirect influence of the Institute may make itself felt in bringing about changes. In 1929, for instance, the organization&apos;s concern in the matter was partly responsible for a reduction in the rates charged for cabling news from Japan. The Institute is at present working on a project designed to help standardize the computation of trade statistics by the various countries of the Pacific. From questions of this sort to influencing alterations in American college entrance requirements with a view to in&#172; creasing the value of Oriental studies or otherwise affecting the educa&#172; tional curriculum, the Institute is operating in a legitimate sphere. But both the philosophy originally laid down for the guidance of the or&#172; ganization and its own experience has shown the wisdom of avoiding action directed towards producing quick legislative results in the political field. Relation to Current Political Events - The question may appropriate&#172; ly be asked&quot;: What justification has such an organization in times like these when immediate solutions are demanded for pressing difficulties? What use is an organization which, for instance, will do nothing immediately to affect the present conflict between China and Japan? A negative answer lies in the manifest superficiality of hurried decisions which in the political realm must so often be made on fragmentary information. The task of the Institute is through continuous study and deliberation to, lay the groundwork of knowledge on which a sound political structure may in the course of time be erected. It must be wary of pressing for action even in the most critical times. The writer previously referred to, sums up this difficult point by stating that the Institute is &quot;not equipped to extricate governments from international crises, particularly when they arise from the faulty past experience of the Pacific peoples. It may and should help to create the inquisitive public opinion in the various countries of the Pacific which may prevent the precipitation of these ugly crises . . . but beyond that it will guard its conduct from being unreal, not by trying to contribute to practical political solutions, but by keeping, no matter what happens, the lamp of disinterested and thorough inquiry ablaze.&quot; It would appear that the function of becoming aware of activity in the Pacific area and the consequences of that activity by constant disin&#172; terested attention and of imparting that awareness to as many citizens of the area as possible, is not only an important one, but is essential if recurring economic and political crises are to be eliminated from the future. In the light of the foregoing discussion the task of members of the Banff round tables will be to comprehend the international economic rela&#172; tions of the Pacific, seeking that understanding needed to contribute to the specialized functions of research and the spreading of information, and to base resulting action particularly of a corporate nature upon lines determined by long-term considerations for promoting the purposes for which the Institute was founded.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>II. THE CONDUCT OF ROUND TABLES The phrase &quot;scientific technique of discussion&quot; is used in connection with Institute Conferences to suggest not that the process of conducting round tables has been reduced to a science in the strict meaning of the word, but that, in comparison with a haphazard procedure, the Institute&apos;s round tables are the well-defined result of considerable analysis and ex&#172; periment. It is recognized that there are several ways in which a group may consider a question depending upon the purpose of the deliberation, the personnel of the group, the subject under consideration, the amount of information available on the topic, and the experience in methods of group discussion. A group of college students studying the industrial revolution under a professor will clearly use a different technique from a meeting of representatives of capital and labor for the purpose of arbitrating a wage scale, yet each is a method of group exploration. Similarly, the board of directors of a corporation, meeting to make certain immediate decisions, will conduct its discussion in a manner quite different from a chamber of commerce gathering called to hear a prominent industrialist speak. Postulates of Institute Discussions In considering the conduct of round tables, therefore, certain as&#172; sumptions having to do with purposes, subject matter, preparation and per&#172; sonnel must be kept in mind. The objects of the discussions being compre&#172; hension of the matter in hand with no immediate resulting action in the political field, the round tables will not endeavor to reach decisions calling for such action. They will subject the topic under consideration to a thorough analysis and move as far as possible along the road of synthesis. Documentation - The conduct of round tables is also conditioned by the elaborate documentation made available prior to the Conference. It is anticipated that every major subject of discussion will be fully supported with data from each of the countries concerned, and, further, that these data will be comparable for each geographical area. The discussions will be conducted on the assumption that each participant is familiar with^these data. There will thus be eliminated from the round tables the necessity^ for introductory statements of fact, for questions of fact, and, except in rare instances, for dispute over facts. The discussions will begin with the problems arising out of the skeleton of fact - with such matters as attitudes, opinions, interpretations, which cannot be successfully docu&#172; mented - and then proceed to a formulation of the problem and subsequent synthesis. Previous Discussions - It has been pointed out in &quot;A Guide to the Banff Discussions that the point of departure for round tables will be the accumulated experience of the four preceding Institute Conferences and the activities the organization has conducted in each intervening biennium. In that certain aspects of the international economic relations of the Pacific have been considered by previous round tables, members of the forthcoming Conference will be expected, in addition to being familiar with the Banff documents, to inform themselves of the earlier considerations of allied topics. The records of past Conferences may be found in the Proceedings published during the year following each of the Conferences.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The Secretariat will, moreover, attempt to summarize the pertinent parts of previous discussions in the syllabi which it will issue shortly before the opening of the Banff sessions. Participation as Individuals - A third premise of the Instituted round table discussions involves the capacity in which and the attitude with which members participate. It will be taken for granted that they take part as individuals, not as representatives of groups, and that they view the subjects to be discussed dispassionately. No opportunity will be given for &quot;making a case&quot; on behalf of this or that interest, group, or nation. The round tables will not be interested in defense as such. On first thought this characteristic may be regarded as making the round table discussions unreal, but this view results from a misinterpretation. There is a vast difference between arguing on behalf of some group and describing for purposes of understanding the characteristics of that group. By the former, understanding becomes secondary to propaganda; by the second, predatory and national interests are analyzed and taken into account as objective realities in a larger situation. Central Secretariat Documents - It may finally be noted, in sug- gesting the background of the round tables, that members will be assumed to be familiar with the three documents being issued by the Central Secre&#172; tariat, in which the aims and activities of the Institute are fully discussed in relation to the Banff Conference. These are A Guide to the Banff Dis&#172; cussions, the present paper, and a report on the work of the International Research Committee which will be issued shortly. Characteristics of the Institute&apos;s Round Tables The object of describing the purposes and background of round tables in the preceding pages has been to furnish a setting for a consideration of the special characteristics of the discussions the Institute has developed. In order to fulfill the purpose for which Conferences are held a certain type of round table procedure is considered most suitable, and its charac-* teristics are further determined by the attitude and knowledge of partici&#172; pants . Group Discussion - Round table discussions are, in the first place, an occasion for group, as distinguished from individual, exploration of a subject. That part of study which can better be performed individually, such as ascertaining the known facts of the matter, is assumed to have been completed by each participant before the round table session begins. The object of the group discussion is to bring to mind a wide variety of reactions, attitudes and interpretations based on objective facts. These attitudes comprise as important a part of the study of a subject as the objective facts themselves. It is believed that the round table method is the most suitable one for revealing these attitudes. For a full under&#172; standing of a question, moreover, individual opinions must be tested and the possibilities of harmonizing them with each other and with objective facts fully explored. The Institute&apos;s round tables, therefore, are quite different from either the lecture or debate methods. In the former an authority gives his audience his own interpretation of events. No opinions, other than</essay:p>

            <essay:p>the lecturerfs, are revealed, and his are not subjected to critical analysis except in the individual minds of those who compose the audi&#172; ence. A debate, or method of parliamentary procedure, furnishes an opportunity for presenting and defending two points of view. Its limi&#172; tations as a method of study lie in the falseness of the assumption that there are merely two sides to a question, and in the necessity for defending a position once taken instead of modifying it in the light of new evidence. The purpose of a round table, on the contrary, is to bring out all relevant points of view, and in the exchange of ideas to further the understanding of the subject under consideration by all participants. Widespread Participation - A closely related characteristic of In&#172; stitute discussions is widespread participation. Members of round tables are in no wise separated into two groups, those who are particularly well- informed on the subject under consideration and who monopolize the discus&#172; sion, and those who sit in as listeners. The topics selected for discussion are comprehensive; each participant is a specialist in certain phases, only the group as a whole may be considered expert on the entire question. The consideration of tariffs, for instance, is not, in the Institute&apos;s view, a subject suitable only for the tariff expert. Although there is a function to be performed by tariff experts in studying this topic, it is not a primary purpose of an Institute Conference. The tariff question, regarded broadly, involves business, legislation, law, education, farming, industry, finance, and a host of other matters in addition to the technical aspects of tariffs as such. Study of the tariff question, to be socially valid, requires the cooperation of persons of diverse experience, each contributing his interpretation into the common crucible. Role of &apos;&apos;Experts&quot; - These considerations lead to a further character&#172; istic of the Institute&apos;s round tables, namely, the role of the so-called expert. It has been suggested in the preceding paragraph that in the dis&#172; cussion of a comprehensive topic each participant is a specialist on certain aspects of the matter, and that only the group is competent on the whole question. The term &quot;expert,&quot; however, is conventionally usod to describe those having greater knowledge of the facts than others. It is desirable to consider the role of this group. One of the purposes of the full documentation prepared for round tables is to render the role of the expert on facts in the discussions themselves of secondary importance to the part played by the comparative layman. In discussions where careful preparation is not expected of parti&#172; cipants, it is customary to have opening statements of fact presented by recognized authorities. The ensuing discussion, frequently crowded into the latter part of the session, usually revolves around these statements. The Institute precludes the dominant part thus played by the expert by taking his function out of the discussions themselves and supplying it in the documentation presented before the opening of round tables. The entire session is thus kept free for the mutual analysis and development of the subject by individuals of diverse experience and attitudes. This is not to imply that the expert on fact has no part in the Institute&apos;s discussions; it is merely intended to view his role in a perspective which the Institute regards as correct.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Round table chairmen will find that discussions at times reach an impasse which can be broken through only by calling upon a recognized authority. Inevitably, the discussions will discover gaps in the factual background given by data papers, they will reach points where expert in&#172; terpretation of facts is required, or they will demand the presentation of interpretive hypotheses. In such instances, the round tables will have to rely on authorities in the matter under consideration. The testimony of experts, however, will be subsidiary to the discussion, not in control of it. Composition of Round Tables - The point which has been stressed throughout this section, the matter of bringing many diverse experiences to bear on the study of a problem, suggests the importance of having a wide variety of individuals at each round table. The Institute endeavors to fulfill this by inviting to the Conference members who will represent a cross-section of the public opinion of each country and by assigning to each round table a group which represents the whole Conference membership. publicity - The type of round table which is here described implies a discussion which is continually moving towards comprehension of the matter at hand. The point of view of each participant, it is expected, will change as it is shared with many other opinions. It consequently becomes important to eliminate any obstacle which tends to fix individual interpretations. One such obstacle prevails in most official and unofficial public delibera&#172; tive bodies, namely, individual publicity. The opinions of prominent persons are customarily broadcast through newspapers, resulting in apparent incon&#172; sistency when these opinions change. By eliminating personal publicity, the Institute endeavors to encourage a continual change of opinion, a change which is a prerequisite to unprejudiced discussion. What publicity is pro&#172; vided is given out impersonally in the name of the round table as a whole. Major and Minor Round Tables - It is customary at Institute Con- ferences for the&apos; entire membership to consider the major topics of the agenda in four or five simultaneous round tables, each having from twenty- five to thirty-five members. Each table usually meets several consecutive days to consider a comprehensive topic. The course of discussion varies from group to group so that each round table is very likely to develop different aspects of the subject from the other. In order that the entire Conference may have the benefit of the deliberations of each table, all the round tables meet together for a short session each day, at which bnel summaries of the discussions are presented. The Conference agenda contains certain minor topics which are of interest to a small section of the membership, and other minor topics develop out of the discussion of the major questions. As the Conference proceeds, therefore, special round tables are set up for the consideration of these problems of less general concern. In some cases a minor subject is so designated because of the paucity of ascertainable facts and a con&#172; sequent lack of background for general participation in the discussion A possible case of this sort at Banff is the practice of dumping, of which the exporters of many nations are accused. There is little accurate data on this question and even the concept, dumping, itself is ill-deimea. In other cases, discussions are restricted to a small group because of the specialized nature of the subject in contrast to a comprehensive problem</essay:p>

            <essay:p>(appropriate for general study. It may develop at Banff, for instance that an outgrowth of the general discussion of tariffs will involve the complicated matter of setting up satisfactory indexes for the measurement of tariff levels. A detail of this kind could be considered only by a specialized group. The general discussion of comprehensive problems will be the main concern of the Conference; specialized round tables will be merely sup&#172; plementary. The agenda for the Banff Conference includes three major categories: first the international economic relations of the Pacific area; and second and third, political and educational implications of these economic rela- tions. Although details for carrying out the agenda have not been determined at the present writing, it may be assumed that these categories will be considered seriatim and that three or four or five round tables will con&#172; sider these matters simultaneously. The principal emphasis of the Conference, economic affairs, will likely consume considerably more time than either political or educational implications. Procedure - Regardless of the varying lines of thought taken bythe different round^tables, each group may be expected to proceed systematically as regards method. In an earlier section of this paper the steps in this procedure have been described as follows: first, the location of the prob&#172; lem bv drawing from all members attitudes and opinions based on the /acts presented in the Conference documents; second, the formulation of the problem and comprehension by all participants of what the problem has been found to be- and. third, the movement towards synthesis, or solution. In a well- managed discussion, the third step should be tlie one on which most attention is concentrated. A successful pursuit of this process should register sig&#172; nificant advances in the &quot;study of the conditions of the Pacific peoples with a view to the improvement of their mutual relations. Informal Discussions - The study of the subjects indicated on the agenda will not, howe^irThe limited to round table sessions The daily schedule will be so arranged as to provide ample opportunity for less formal conversations and discussions. The Institute does not seek to establish round table procedure as the sole method of study during Con&#172; ferences; on the contrary, it sets up organized discussions simply *s ^ most suitable framework for study and numerous other methods will be utilized to furnish the details. Round Table Administration - A word may be added in regard to the administration of the Conference as it relates to the round tables. The International Program Committee, composed of a representat^?/^?&#8482;o National Council, is charged with drawing up the agenda. This Committee announced the principal subjects for the Banff Conference in the fall of 1931 and subsequently issued a more detailed agenda. Shortly before the Conference it will determine precisely what the round table topics will be and it will draw up a schedule covering the duration of the sessions according to which the subjects on the agenda may, in its opinion, be most successfully studied. It will then appoint chairmen and &#171;c^&quot;&#187; for the discussions and with the cooperation of the latter draw up outlines for each round table. These outlines will be designed to suggest, though</essay:p>

Chairmen and Secretaries of Round Tables Responsibility for the successful conduct of the type of round tables which haTe been discussed in the foregoing sections falls upon those in charge of the docmentation, those who draft the agenda and discus icn utlines, the participants themsel^s and particularly the &#8482;&#8482;*^&#163; chairmen and secretaries. It is the latter who must see to it that the actuaTdiseussions make the fullest possible use of the information and personnel available, A round table chairman is first of all a manager of discussions and he is selected for qualifications in that direction rather than for e.ther expertness in the subject under consideration or prestige. It is his pri Sy task to facilitate the process of discussion; m so doing he must b&#171;ar Tn mind the criteria cf a successful round table, such as, the vigor of the discussion, widespread participation on the part of members, ^ e*P^a- tion of the matter at hand, close adherence to the subject and &#163;e&#187;f&quot;&#163;* progress towards the resolution of opposing views.

            <essay:p>The quality of general awareness of the possibilities of a topic, n the part of chairmen, called for by the above considerations, is quite different from the quality of expert knowledge of some aspect of the subject matter. Persons with the latter qualification are not likely to be successful discussion leaders; they are too likely to play the role of a teacher who dominates the session rather than that of a chairman^who simply guides its course. A chairman is not expected to exploit his posi-^ tion to intrude his own ideas any more conspicuously than any other parties pant In the discussion. In view of these considerations it is evident that the positions of chairmen and secretaries demand definite qualities not necessarily asso&#172; ciated with prestige or nationality. The chairmanship is not given in order to honor an individual or a national group, ^The sole consideration in making these appointments is successful discussion.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>A RESEARCH PROGRAM IN THE PACIFIC AREA I. INTRODUCTION The constitution of the Institute of Pacific Relations defines it las an international body for the study of the conditions of the Pacific jpeoples with a view to the improvement of their mutual relations. Two jother papers issued by the Central Secretariat for the members of the Banff iConference. A Guide to the Banff Discussions and The Purpose and Conduct Jof Round Tables,&apos; have suggested the various means which the Institute lemploys to achieve this aim and have stressed the interrelation of these [means. Conference discussions, researoh, the spreading of information, Und other methods utilized to bring about wide-spread understanding of the laffairs of the area mutually condition each other. Discussion reveals gaps lin the facts known which must be filled by research; research carries study to a point where, in order to bring it into line with actual situations, its [results must be qualified by attitudes, opinions and interpretations brought [out in discussions. The principles upon which the Institute was founded preclude it from reaching corporate decisions or taking corporate action in the field of international politics. To get understanding rather than designate policies, ito diagnose international controversies rather than prescribe immediate remedies, to study rather than preach, - these have been its constant aims. ! Being unofficial, it has had no responsibility towards special interests of any sort, whether governmental or commercial. It has steadfastly sought to eliminate prejudices and presuppositions in its study of public affairs, at the same time recognizing current attitudes as part of a complicated objective situation. The single premise upon which the Institute has con&#172; ducted its activities has been that intelligent dealing with the problems ol ^the Pacific area presupposed widespread understanding of the forces at work. It is evident that research must play a conspicuous role in the ful&#172; fillment of the Institute&apos;s aims. An attempt is made in the foilowing#pages to describe the way in which the Institute promotes research, the policies which guide these efforts, and the scope and emphasis of the research program. Each research project is the outgrowth of a need for accurate information determined by discussions or the educational programs, or previous research, and the entire research program forms an integral, not an isolated part of the Institute&apos;s activities. II. POLICIES AND PROBLEMS OF RESEARCH In carrying on research on an international scale the Institute has not been able to rely on the experience of others. Its policies have been shaped in the course of pioneering in a relatively new field. Research methods, once applied almost exclusively to the exact sciences, have in re&#172; cent decades been used increasingly in the study of human relations -through the social sciences. For a long time, however, such research was limited to</essay:p>

            <essay:p>local, domestic problems in individual countries - a characteristic which stiU prevails. Only under the impetus of the World War and of the acute international crisis since then has increasing attention been directed to- wardrthe international social, economic, and political relations of people. But researoh in international relations, - a point that has been eimhasized by an officer of a large American research organization -ms at first conducted by individual research workers, or ad hoc organizations motivated by the desire to solve an urgent political, economic or moral problem. The results were haphazard and concentrated upon crises^whion called for immediate solutions, thereby emphasizing abnormalities in national conduct. This method neglected the continual accumulation of information on the normal behavior of people and the systematic analysis and Interpretation of data. It neglected, in other words, the well-ordered scheme of study which must underlie any understanding of why people behave as they do when crises arise. The need of systematic research in the relations of the people of the Pacific area was recognized by the Institute in its early Conferences, but a technique for carrying it out was not at hand. tor*a&#187; proles had to be laid down for later modification and development, and these *aro bten the directing policies Wider which an extensive program of investigation has been pursued. Limiting the Institute&apos;s Function The function of the Institute of Pacific Relations is essentially that of initiating and correlating the activity of other ^ganisatxons xn the direction of the Institute&apos;s aims. From the outset it has declined create an elaborate organization of its own. Applied to ^earoh, ^ policy has restrained the Institute from carrying on tavesti^tions itself and from maintaining a staff for that purpose. There exist in &#171;**&quot;&#163;&#163;&#9632;&#187; area numerous institutions qualified to undertake research into the problems of the region, there are others which with assistance promise to become qualified. The Institute has endeavored to stimulate and cor &#187;!&#187;*&#8226; ***?* of these organisations rather than erect a superstructure of its own which in the end would likely turn out less valuable results. A case in point is the study of land utilization which an early Conference recognized to be basic to problems of population P^-^i and migration. Successful investigation of this sub3ect invol^special information on the social and economic conditions of m &#171;&#187; ntion Sngmge China and Canada or the Philippines and Hew Zealand, not to mention language differences and varieties of dialects within the language groups. Tocreate a centralized research organization capable of undertaking ^tailed^ comprehensive studies into this question would have been &#8226;&#187;&quot;&#171;1*&#163;d&#176;g&#163; siv^ and time-consuming, and it is doubtful whether ^results would^have been satisfactory. There were, moreover, a.number of ^^^A.^ several of the countries concerned in which studies of land utilization were planned or already under way and investigation by a new research body would have caused much duplication.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The Institute adopted the contrary method of using what resources^ &apos;or researoh were available in each area selected for investigation, limit- ng its own role to that of stimulation, coordination and financial assist&#172; ance. In some instanoes, it was necessary only to bring work already under ray into line with a comprehensive scheme covering a larger area and relat- .ng to a wider group of social and economic questions. In others, it was accessary during the early stages of investigation to make provision for gaining a corps of workers to serve in more technical capacities during iater stages. There were a few cases in which the Institute had to seek &gt;ut and persuade appropriate agencies to conduct the necessary studies. Jertain areas, finally, had already been adequately investigated and the Institute&apos;s task ms limited to applying their results to the comprehensive Itudy of the Pacific region. Selecting Researoh Agencies In entrusting projects to existing agencies two considerations have ruled; first, that research should be conducted by the best persons and institutions available, but that other things being equal, nationals of the Country in which the study is to be conducted should have priority; and, fsecond, rather than disperse funds widely, that a few research centers i^hould be steadily cultivated over a considerable period of years with a [Mew to developing able research staffs in various parts of the Pacific. Viewed over a long span, a program of research involves not only obtaining data on specified subjects but also in the course of securing that informa&#172; tion training a body of investigators who will later be capable of conduct- &apos;jlng research themselves. It is conceivable that a particular project ifBould be carried out as well or better by foreigners than by nationals. put if the project is turned over to the former, the only lasting result will be the study itself. If the work is done by an institution of the lountry conoerned there will remain after the project is completed not only the report of that investigation but also a group the better prepared for further work. The same reasoning has suggested the wisdom of concentrat- ing the resources of the Institute upon a few institutions on the supposition that assisting these for several consecutive years would result in more permanent benefits than aiding more organizations for shorter periods. This policy has pertained particularly to a country such as China here social and political disturbances have placed well-nigh unsurmountable obstacles in the way of objective study. When the Institute initiated its program of research seven years ago there were, despite these handicaps, a few centers in that country which with the assurance of continued support Promised to develop strong research organizations. The Institute, conse&#172; quently, set about strengthening these centers by entrusting to them long- term projects in land utilization, industrialization and migrations. The outcome has been, in addition to excellent reports on these subjects, the Establishment of well-equipped and well-staffed institutions capable of Carrying out a continuing program of research. In the pursuit of this policy of concentration on a few institutions certain disadvantages have become increasingly apparent. By strengthening a few centers, others have been neglected, and, to continue with the example of China, data and problems of the areas of the institutions selected have Wn studied to the partial exclusion of other regions.

            <essay:p>nf a brief investigation into the problems of the southward migration of bhe Chinese, the Institute has made no contacts with universities in south China. This criticism applies also to the western interior of^ China. This has resulted in part from the apparent absence of promising research organizations in the social sciences in those areas and partly from the aforementioned policy of concentrating the Institute&apos;s ^ited resources. A counter tendency is at present in evidence among those charged with the supervision of the Institute&apos;s research program. It may be anticipated that the policy of concentration will be somewhat relaxed in an effort to cover a wider area and to stimulate research in a larger jnumber of organizations. Cooperative Research It has been suggested in the first paragraphs of this^ section that the Institute had in large measure to de^lop a technique of international research, there being few precedents to follow. One of the P^wPft3; f^&quot; ficulties has been to work out methods whereby analagous Pf0^^0^^,^^ investigated simultaneously in the many diverse environments of the Pacific area, and comparable data secured from each. The technique of research in the international field which the ; Institute is developing is illustrated by the procedure adopted in studying the question of aliens. The need for research into the Pf*}^ ^^^^ out in round table discussions of extraterritorial jurisdiction in China. It Is soon recognized that considering the subject as unique to China threw it 21 o? proportion and eliminated the valuable possibility of bringing the experience and practice of other countries to bear on it. It ^S also realized that the problem of aliens was held in common by all the countries of the Pacifio and that only in its particular manifestations was it peculiar to any one. In consequence, each National Council of the Institute was requested to prepare a paper on the status of aliens ^ first limited to the legal aspects of the question) in its area. &#8482;&#163; papers were completed in the intervening biennium before the next Conference, and during the latter they were reviewed by a subcommittee of specialists. An optimum standard was established by this group and preseatod to the authors of the papers with the request that they revise their papers accord&#172; ingly. At the same time an authority was asked to undertake the co- orlination of these separate studies and the direction of the requestedr&#163; visions. In the latter task assistance was given by the Central Secretariat. The coordinating study, it is expected, will shortly ** *^e* *f *f fQ^ &amp; close the legal phase of the status of aliens study. It may then be found that further studies in regard to the social and economic status of ^&#8482; will be needed for a full understanding of the problems involved and in that case further cooperative investigations will be called for to be followed by another coordinating study. The procedure is not always so clearcut as the above description implies. In studying the tariff problems on the Pacific area, the Institute has had to proceed more slowly. It was found ^possible to se&#172; cure comparable data from a series of decentralized studies, f&#176;r &#8482; schedule of investigation could be drawn up which would produce correlated results. The Institute has consequently at the same time organized separate surveys of national tariffs and their effect on trade and a</essay:p>

            <essay:p>^centralized study of the trade and tariffs of the whole area designed especially to set up criteria by which tariffs could be subsequently mea&#172; sured in each country. Further steps in investigating this problem will depend upon the results of these studies now under way. Research and International Politics Study of the sort of human problems with which the Institute is con&#172; cerned has created further problems in conducting research. Although the organization does&apos;not&apos;concern itself with bringing about immediate political results, it, nevertheless, keeps an eye on the practical world of current events. At Conferences, the discussions center on the phenomena ^underlying current, political manifestations, and they seek to throw light on the causes rather than on remedial details. The areas of these discus&#172; sions, however, is close enough to subjective thought and activity and to matters which must meet at least a long-term pragmatic test to create dif&#172; ficulties for scientific research. A task of research in the Institute is [bo study moot points which have arisen in previous discussions and to docu&#172; ment succeeding Conferences. There is thus imposed upon the research program L connection with practical affairs with which researoh, as such, is tradi&#172; tionally unaccustomed. It is not necessarily true, however, that the nearer research ap&#172; proaches current events, that is, the more it is designed to effect change, the less it is scientific. The work of the entomologist is often determined Jby the immediate aim of improving crop yield, yet his investigations do not thereby become less objective. On the contrary, to the extent that he has allowed ulterior considerations to influence his studies his results lack usefulness to the agriculturist. In the social sciences the problem^is more complicatedi the study of human relations is not yet to be classed with the exact sciences. In the investigation of society it is altogether more dif&#172; ficult to eliminate presuppositions. For this reason the research program of the Institute runs into danger in holding close to the area of practical affairs&#169; The Institute cannot claim to have evolved a complete formula out of f&apos;this difficulty. Certain of the policies described above, however, tend to |ensure scientific work. Decentralized investigations, at worst, would re&#172; peal many opposing prejudices which in the process of coordination would be largely cancelled out. The constant testing of researches in Conference discussions provide a further check. The problem, moreover, is forced to (the point of the ridiculous when it is regarded at its worst, for, naturally, this contingency is eliminated by the selection of qualified research workers and institutions. The problem, nevertheless, remains and was summarized by the Jlnstitutets then research secretary for the Conference of Representatives of ^Institutions for the Scientific Study of International Relations in Paris, 11930, in the following words: &quot;In the effort to combine thoroughness in research with practical needs., to deal adequately with fundamental systematic problems of description and analysis and yet provide the information necessary for discussion of immediate and changing issues, and to</essay:p>

            <essay:p>maintain scholarly standards without ignoring those regions of social life for which established and quantitative research methods are not yet worked out and perhaps never can be worked out, the Institute as yet has made only very tentative and partial experiments&#187; The humanizing of knowledge is a difficult process. It would be comparatively easy to initiate and administer a research program which would satisfy the social scientists of the Pacific. It is a much more difficult matter to find one which will satisfy both them and those who are interested rather in practical solutions of immediate problems of grave urgency. It is an open question whether the Institute of Pacific Relations will be able to hold the two points of view together long enough for a solution to be worked out.&quot; Since the above comment was made the Institute has partly eliminated the problem by drawing a sharper distinction between research projects and Conference data papers. The latter are for the most part not research, but either summaries of research already completed or surveys of data elsewhere available. Data papers are short statements of fact designed for the specific purpose of documenting the discussion of certain topics. Some of the projects oontained in the research program furnish material for data papers or even the papers themselves, others provide information for a future Conference. The research program is only partially determined by the agenda of the next Conference, but being directed towards international relations of the Pacific it inevitably contributes some data to each Conference. The distinction, nevertheless, remains clear that data papers are prepared specifically for Conference purposes and they may or may not involve research, whereas the research program has no immediate objective other than adding to the general body of information, Seleotion of Projects There remains for consideration the Institute&apos;s policy of selecting topics for research. These were determined early in the Institute&apos;s history by Conference discussions. In order to discover what facilities and investi&#172; gators were available the secretary of the International Research Committee undertook a general tour of the Pacific area during the course of which and in consultation with established research centers he made additional recom&#172; mendations. The suggestions made by the round tables had to be modified by the available facilities for research in the Pacific, and these together with the recommendations of the secretary were subjected to further scrutiny by experts called upon to advise the organization to which the Institute applied for funds. This way of inaugurating research was not conducive to a logical and systematic program. Even had it been possible to draw up such a program, which is doubtful, there would have been no way to carry it out. For these reasons the Institute&apos;s researches might be expected to have been unrelated and scattered. It is surprising to find, as the next section will indicate, that this was not entirely true and that the program revealed a fairly systematic grouping of projects around a few fundamental problems. In every case subjects were chosen for investigation which lay beneath the surface of events, in many questions the groundwork had even to be laid in regions apparently only remotely conneoted with practical affairs. This is perhaps an explanation of the degree to which in retrospect a correlated program is found to have been initiated, for the further investiga&#172; tion pushes behind the everyday behavior of people the greater is the common</essay:p>

            <essay:p>denominator of causation. Only in surface events does there appear to be universal disparity. The subsequent development of the research program grew out of later Conferences and out of the findings of earlier projects. As soon as discussion and research began mutually to support each other, a more systematic method of study became evident in both. Gradually, moreover, the Institute gained insight into the affairs of the Pacific area and with this came the ability to maintain a more coordinated scheme of investigation. In the minds of several of those in charge of the Institute&apos;s re&#172; search the point has now been reached when further studies can be mapped out according to a general plan to which each project will have a definite relation. It is for this reason that the International Research Committee has announced its intention during the Banff Conference to keep itself free from administrative details in order to devote its time to a thorough survey of research in the Pacific with a view to establishing a systematic scheme for further studies. Valuable precedents for the planning of research have been furnished it by the Social Science Research Council. III. RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION The Institute&apos;s research activities are carried on by research com&#172; mittees under each of its national units and by an International Research Committee composed of a representative from each of the local committees. The executive work of the international committee is attended to by a research secretary attached to the Central Secretariat. The International Research Committee, constitutionally, is advisory to the Pacific Council, the governing body of the Institute, and it merely makes recommendations to the Pacific Council which has the power to amend or veto. In fact, how&#172; ever, the Pacific Council has traditionally accepted the recommendations of the International Research Committee without change. The Research Committees of the various National Councils are respon&#172; sible for the initiation and approval of all research projects to be carried out within their territory. The projects may arise from suggestions by individual research workers, by applications for assistance from such bodies as universities or educational associations, or by the direct invitation of the Research Committee to such bodies or individuals. In every case the local Researoh Committee lias full initiative and power. It may recommend to its Council that projects be amended, dropped, or proceeded with in differ&#172; ent ways. It may utilize funds available in its own country, request other research bodies to conduct investigations, or to recommend its Council to make grants. Every National Council has dealt with some part of its researoh program in these waysj but most Councils have asked for financial help for projects beyond their own resources. Such projects are sent on with the endorsement of the National Councils upon the recommendation of their Research Committees. The financial resources of the International Research Committee are obtained from an American Foundation on a yearly basis. Part of the grant is given the Committee outright, the remainder on condition</essay:p>

            <essay:p>that two dollars for every one be raised from other sources for expenditure on the same projects. Beginning in 1934 the condition will be raised to a three-to-one basis. The International Research Committee, therefore, in making grants, imposes the condition that the recipient raise for the same purposes a similar amount from other sources. The more difficult requirements which will become effective in 1934 will be passed on to the recipients of grants. The effect of this condition is to enable the Institute to carry on a more extensive program than its resources would otherwise permit and also to encourage the maintenance of research centers by local funds. When projects have been recommended by the International Research Committee and approved by the Pacific Council, responsibility for their execution and for the expenditure of whatever funds are granted is put in the hands of a trustee institution, which may be one of the Institute&apos;s National Councils, or a university or other research body. The development of the project is closely watched by the secretary of the Committee, fre&#172; quent progress reports and financial accountings being called for. The Institute has adhered as closely as possible to the policy of not making the administration of research a charge on its research funds. In so far as possible this fund is devoted exclusively to the research work itself, expenses incident to administration being met from the general funds at the disposal of the Central Secretariat. This policy, it has been felt, is consistent with the aim of limiting the Institute&apos;s functions to those of administration and coordination of work carried on by others. The distinction which is made between research and the preparation of data papers has been discussed in a preceding section. It was pointed out that data papers, for the most part, do not involve research but only the application of the results of research for Conference uses. The pre&#172; paration of data papers, nevertheless, falls under the purview of research administration. Most of the initiative for these papers as well as the task of putting them through the press and distributing them is taken care of by the various National Research Committees, The International Committee, however, is responsible for obtaining from each area comparable data and for determining methods for publication and distribution which will be co&#172; ordinated and efficient. IV. CURRENT AND PUBLISHED PROJECTS AND PAPERS It is premature to give a complete account of the subjects which have been studied in the Institute&apos;s program of research. Only a beginning has been made in dissecting and analyzing the phenomena underlying the rela&#172; tions of the peoples of the Pacific area. Certain topics have been carried farther than others, the investigation of some has been postponed either for want of research vacilities or funds or until discussion and thought can more sharply define the problem. A complete account moreover, will more appro&#172; priately be contained in histories, commentaries and surveys of the area yet to be written which will utilize - as Mr. Tawney has done in Land and Labour in China - all of the information made available by the Institute as well as by other agencies.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>A topical discussion of the Institute&apos;s research program, moreover, would have to take into account a considerable number of studies in whioh the organization played a very inconspicuous part. In accordance with its policy of stimulating work through other institutions, much of what lies within its broad program has no apparent connection with it. At the other extreme are the studies which the Institute has published under its own imprint. Between the two is an indefinite fringe of studies and papers to&#172; wards which the Institute made a greater or lesser contribution. The present attempt to describe the subjects in which the Institute has carried on researoh, therefore, is limited to listing the titles of pro&#172; jects now under way and of those on which published reports have been made. Current Projects There are listed below the projects which are currently being carried on by the institutions designated and with funds granted by the International Research Committee. It is not possible at the time this report is written to give an accurate list of the papers on which the various National Councils are at work for the Banff Conference, In order to make this account of current projects comparable with the long list of published works, data papers for the forthcoming Conference should be included, &quot;but inasmuch as full informa&#172; tion is not available as to titles and authors, it is suggested that the authorized list of data papers which will be issued to each member at the Conference be appended to this report. 1, &quot;Dependencies and Native Peoples of the Pacific&quot;: a cooperative inter&#172; national study directed by Mr, F. M. Keesing and under the general super&#172; vision of the Chairman and Secretary of the International Research Com&#172; mittee . 2, &quot;Land Utilization, Population and Food Consumption in China&quot;: under the direction of Professor J. Lossing Buck, Department of Agriculture, University of Nanking, 3&apos;, &quot;Land Utilization in Japan&quot;: under the direction of Professor Shiroshi Nasu, Department of Agriculture, Tokyo Imperial University, 4, &quot;Redistribution of Population in the Philippine Islands&quot;: under the direction of Professor S. Macaraig, University of the Philippines. 5, &quot;Land Utilization in Australia&quot;: under the auspices of the Australian Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations. 6. &quot;Land Utilization in New Zealand&quot;: under the direction of Professor H.

Most titles will be found included under more than one category, a national and a subject, and in several oases under the two or three subjects on which the paper bears. Under each category is listed publications which vary from short mimeographed summaries for Conference purposes to full length books representing years of research. It has hot been thought advisable to separate one from the other because be&#172; tween the two are found such a variety of documents that valid distinctions into what is research and what is not could hardly be made. All of the fol&#172; lowing items do not strictly &quot;belong In the Instituted research program. However, inasmuch as they belong to the research activity of the Institute more than to any other, and for the additional reason that such a list may prove useful, all of the Institute&apos;s publications are herewith included. It should be remembered that data papers for the Banff Conference will be found neither in the list following nor in the preceding section; these will be announced in an authorized list at the beginning of the Conference.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>THE FRAMEWORK AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE BANFF DISCUSSION IN AN organization which has so little use for long public statements as the Institute of Pacific Relations, there is possibly some need to give reasons for the one I am about to make. Rightly or wrongly, it has been said that it is necessary to have as a starting-point an outline of the conditions responsible for the Banff Conference discussions, which will put the different &apos;Round-Table&apos; questions into some sort of relation with the papers which have been sent to all the representatives. An attempt has been made to get most of these papers into the hands of the represen&#172; tatives long enough before the start of the Conference to make it possible for them to have gone through most, if not all of them. I will, then, take it as certain that you have at least had a look at most of the papers, to which attention will later be given. In earlier meetings of the Institute, this sort of general statement has been less necessary and so has not been made. The reason for thi&#174; was that most of the representatives at these meetings had a more or less clear idea of what was covered by the questions put down for discussion. It is true that these questions were not any of them simple; in fact most of them were very complex, and had their roots deep down in other questions which seemed completely outside the field of discussion. But though they were complex, all of them were of current interest, and all the representatives were conscious of the clear and important connection they had with the cheif international events of the time. How is it, then, that the present field of discussion is different from that of other conferences? It seems that the best answer may be given by reading part of the little book which Dr. Hu Shih and myself got out early in 1932. The statement is there made that in making plans for t&apos;he 1933 meeting the Program Committee was giving an outlet to the opinions put forward by the general conference representatives! in the &apos;Round-Tables&apos; which took place at the end of the China Conference. The feeling among a number of representatives in these discussions was that the time had come for the Institute to give more attention to those deeper questions which were internationally important and common to all ths chief countries of the Pacific, in place of giving most of its&apos; time, asi it had done in the Third and Fourth Conferences, to questions in connection with one country or one special part of a country. The point of this decision was not so much that the Institute had any idea of giving up</essay:p>

            <essay:p>its earlier system of having discussions&apos; about the chief political questions of the time, but that a clearer statement was needed of the relations between these political questions and those slow-moving and frequently unseen forces in society and economic organization which are their causes. In this way, in the opinion of the Program Committee, the 1933 Conference would be able to make it clear that any one burning political question&#8212;such as the position of Shanghai, or the trouble in Manchuria&#8212; was in fact only one (though an important one) of a number of other questions of the same sort in other parts of the Pacific. It was hoped, in addition, that the new angle of attack would make it possible for countriesi other than China and Japan to give to the &apos;Round-Table&apos; discussions much more of their experience than had been possible at past Conferences. So that you will not, any of you, get the feeling that the decisions about these discussions have been made without your knowledge and are now suddenly put before you at this late stage, let me quickly give you a rough outline of the steps in the working out of the plans which are responsible for this opening meeting. Most of you are conscious of the fact that the Banff Conference was started at the end of the Shanghai Conference. When the International Program Committee had come to a decision to take up the general question of &apos;Conflict (a) and Control&apos;, a letter was sent to all representatives who had been at the Conference and to all National Councils, giving a rough outline of the questions which in the opinion of the International Office would most probably come up for discussion. Two months later came a small book of forty pages put out by Dr. Hu Shih and myself, which was sent to all the National Councils. In this we made an attempt to give some sort of picture of the wider international economic, political, and more general interests which have to do with the coming discussions. At the same time we gave examples of possible questions and of suggestions for reading in the eighteen months before this meeting. Between then and last March the International Office was able to get the opinions of a great number of the Institute&apos;s supporters by letter, and in the light of these it was able to make the range of some parts of the first outline narrower, and to put some of the questions in a better form. After this there was a meeting at New York in September 1932, at which there were representatives! of five or six National Councils. After two or three days&apos; discussion the group was able to come to an agreement as to the three chief fields of interest which have been put down in today&apos;s discussion outline. The general plan made by this group is the one which was later sent to all National Councils in the form of a short paper; and the greater part of it was printed again in the paper named &apos;A Guide to the Banff Discussions&quot;, which was sent out in May by the Honolulu office. Using this outline as a guide, the International office, in the middle of last July, made a list of the special questions which it seemed wise to put before the &apos;Round-Table&apos;. These have been used in the week before the opening of the Conference by the International Program Committee in its meetings, and from them have come the lists of questions for discussion which will be given to you every, morning at</essay:p>

            <essay:p>the Round-Tables. It is, then, unnecessary for me to give you any details of ttiis&apos; outline; it is enough for me to say that the first heading &quot;Economic Conflict in the Pacfic Area: Its Control and Adjustment&quot; will give material for the greater part of the Banff discussions. It seems probable that the second heading about questions of educa&#172; tion will be looked at more from a general point of view than in detail; and that these discussions will be taken chiefly as first steps in the direction of the 1935 Conference which will probably give more time to educational questions than to any other field. THE WARRING FORCES IN THE PACIFIC After these observations, let me now go on to the harder business of giving some account of the conditions at the back of the economic and political troubles about to come under discussion. There are a number of ways of attacking these questions and I have no desire to give you the idea that the angle from which 1 am looking at them is better than others. But it is simplest for me to see the warring forces all over the Pacific, in economic and political fields, and equally in the field of education, as caused by the fact that there is not a good adjustment between geograph&#172; ical limits and the economic needs of the nations in question. The anthropologist may give a deeper account of it in relation to changes in ways of living; the political expert may give greater weight to the political signs of these warring tendencies; but my training has been in economics and you will have to let me make the attack from the angle which is most natural to me. Agi I see it, then, these bad adjustments are like a number of unequal forces acting on the different countries. The first of these is the unequal distribution of natural produce: that is to say, of food, of good farm land, or of materials for industry. This is common knowledge and it is unnecessary to say more about it. Japan, for example, is without enough coal (f) and iron (f) if she is looking forward to the development of her industries in years to come; Canada is dependent on other countries for cotton (f) and silk (f). Second, there are the effects of an unequal distribution of population. This is, in part, the effect of the first conditions: which I have been talking about, and in part the effect of conscious economic development. Then comes the fact that conditions of living are unequal; that is to say, not only is living cheaper in some countries than in others, but the deeper values themselves are different in different societies, so that ideas of material well-being are unlike. Fourth, there is the unequal distribution of political power in the Pacific. Some countries are politically dependent while, at the other end of the scale, others are great Powers. Because of these different levels of political power (some would say because of unequal military and sea-power) some countries&apos; are more able to take care of their economic interests than others. And last, countries are put in unequal positions through the operation of time: in the sense that by chance or by design some countries have got a better position through having been first in the field of trade or in the development of industry; and looking at the other</essay:p>

            <essay:p>side of the picture, countries now starting their economic development make the discovery that they are kept back and walled-in by competition with countries which have been longer in the field. What is even more serious, they frequently see that they are shut out from certain parts of the great markets because these have been made the private property of the first comers. Quite clearly, one side of this question is the way in which some of the most important colonies of the earth, such as Indo-China, Formosa, or parts of Africa, are walled off for the special use of the mother-country. Now for a long time these unequal forces inside the different countries were able to go on side by side simply because there had been little development of the connections between the different parts of the Pacific. It was as if there were a number of vessels full of different gases in different conditions of expansion and with different chemical properties, side by side but kept seperate from one another. But now, with the development of physical transport through railways, roads, and steamships, and the development of apparatus for the transport of ideas such as over-sea telegrams and radio, which are seen less but have even greater effects, it is as if the different vessels had been joined together by pipes. Some of the pipes are wide, so that the different forces quickly become equal. Others are small or are stopped up in some way, so that it takes a long time for a complete adjustment. But generally it is true to say that there is a tendency in the direction of some sort of levelling, and in so far as the gases were said to have different chemical properties, there is a tendency for reactions to take place between them, which may be more or less violent, and in which much heat may be produced. The joining together of the different parts of the Pacific was not a process taking place by itself. The very opposite is true: it was part of a great expansion of political, economic, and other forces from the west of Europe and North America. This is in fact the process to which we have given the name of &quot;expansionism&quot; in the outline of the present dis^ cussions. But for one or two details, we might say that it is almost the same as that process to which the supporter of Marx gives the name of &quot;imperialism.&quot; It is a process which was possibly at its highest develop&#172; ment between 1890 and 1900. The clearest and most surprising sign of it was the competition among the Great Powers of the West to be first in marking off for themselves great stretches of land in countries at a lower stage of development, or in getting important economic rights in &apos;countries which were not so strong, such as China, Persia, and South America. One example of it was the division of Africa, another was the Violent competition between England, Germany, and Russia to get special rights in China, while another was the way in which Japan got control of important colonies by taking Formosa and Korea. Sometimes it was a cause of open war: for example, between Spain and the United States or Russia and Japan; at other times no fight was put up against the process. Frequently the rewards were great, and there is no doubt that much of the driving-force in this expansion came from the desire to get</essay:p>

            <essay:p>materials for industry, and specially the produce of colonies. Frequently, however, later history has made it seem very probable that the reward was not great enough for the trouble, and it is possible to give examples of competition for power which now seem surprisingly foolish. There was a time in the 1880&apos;s when the harbour at Apia in Samoa had in it the warships of four or five great Powers, all making attempts to get the support of the island chiefs. It is true that there were great economic tendencies at the back of this expansion of the Powers cf the West; but it isi important to keep in mind that there were in addition great political and other forces. In fact, it is probable that this expansion is best seen as a surprisingly complex knot of purposes, in which the hope of profit was mixed up with ideas of giving law and order to such countries&apos; as the Philippines and China, and with the less self-interested desire to give the Christianity and education of the West to persons who seemed in the opinion of Europe to be living at a much lower level. And these mixed purposes are very far from being a thing of the past. Unhappily, one sees a number of signs of them in the political events of today. So that this &quot;expansionism&quot; was not simply an outburst of economic forces or the effect of a desire to get new materials for industry and control of new markets; it was equally an outgoing current of political ideas and ways of living. From another point of view it may be of use to see the complete process as one of motion. In some places populations themselves moved in an attempt to get away from the hard living-conditions in the countries of the West, where the development of industry came earlier. It was, in fact because they gave such outlets that certain forms of expansion through colonies were supported. In other places there was an outgoing current of money for investment and with it some of the ideas, inven&#172; tions, and forms of organization which had come into being with the growth of industry in the West. Almost everywhere it took the form of trade witn other countries. This; is only another name for the distribution of goods and services. After a certain stage of development in the indus&#172; tries of one country, these goods were produced in ever-increasing amounts which made new outlets into other countries necessary; and, on the other side, when these outlets: had been made, it was necessary to get control of new places overseas where the materials for industry were produced. Together with all this there was a current of ideas, some of which took root in the countries at a lower stage of economic development, and have later been used for ttie organization of those countries on the lines! of the West. Some were ideas about the quai rights of man which have taken root in new places and are producing strange fruit. Others were ideas about conditions of material well-being and the right to be free, which are causing great changes in the older forms of society still in existence in a number of Pacific countries. The outcome of all this is that today almost every part of the Pacific has been changed by outside economic and political control and new ideas of education. In almost all these places there are parts of the population</essay:p>

            <essay:p>which come from other nations; almost everywhere business is supported by investments from other countries, or money has been sent out to other countri&#8364;s for business purposes: the lands which are not politically dependent on some oversea power are responsible for the government of some colony or dependent country. What is more, almost no land has gone through these processes without some sort of trouble. It is in this question that the Banff Conference will probably be chiefly interested. The trouble may or may not have taken serious political forms, though frequently it has done so. Sometimes the chief sign of it has been the existence of a generally unbalanced condition of the public mind, so that unimportant or chance events such as the putting to death of a military man or the punishment of a chief (for example, in a colony) have in a very short time been increased to the size of serious international troubles. To those outside the country this condition may possibly be seen as a wave of public feeling as if a serious attack was being made on the inter&#172; national position of the country; while looked at from the inside it may seem to be simply an outlet for a nation&apos;s feelings, sometimes right and sometimes wrong, against an increasingly great weight of economic and other forces. Most of those who have given attention to the forces at the back of the changes in the government of Germany In the past year, or to the political conditions within Japan (1) which were responsible for the fight&#172; ing in Manchuria, will be ready to give full value to these psychological developments which have frequently been given little attention. Whatever form the outburst may take, it is important to keep in mind the fact that its deeper causes may be a long way from the special point about which argument is taking place. It is in part for this reason that this Confer&#172; ence is not simply giving its attention to two or three of the chief inter&#172; national questions in the Pacific. Its experience in past conferences has made it clear that numbers of these international ills have their roots deep down in questions which are very different from those which are at present causing trouble &#8212; questions which are frequently not international in any sense, but have to do only with conditions inside the country. In such questions&#8212;and the discussions at our &apos;Round-Tables&apos; will almost certainly put numbers of them before us&#8212;it is clearly a waste of time for discus&#172; sion and suggestions to be limited to the international side only; that is to say, we will not go very far if we make a decision to keep out of the discussion all questions which are generally taken to be the private business of one country, with the old story that international discussion of them would be an attack on the rights of nations. Because of this belief that for a full knowledge of all the different forms which these warring tendencies may take in the international field it is necessary to give the fullest possible attention to the different forces at the back of them, the Institute has made a request to the National Councils to give space in their Conference papers to getting at the ways (1) See &quot;Behind the Par Eastern Conflict,&quot; American Council Institute of Pacific Relations, p.p 14-20. i</essay:p>

            <essay:p>in which the different group interests in a country may make use of their power over the government. In addition there has been a request for accounts of the ways in which these special interests&#8212;(Chambers of Commerce, organizations of business men, workers, producers etc.) &#8212; have become united for their common profit, or have been forced to come into an organization in the interests of public well-being. This observation may do something to make it clear to representatives at this Conference why an international group (such as this) is giving attention to such seemingly private questions as rice-control (f) in Japan or the organiza&#172; tion of the sugar (f) industry in Hawaii, or the work of the National In&#172; dustrial Recovery Board in the United States. The reason is that a number of the attemptsi at control inside a nation are faced with the same sort of troubles, on a smaller scale, as those which have to be overcome if attempts at international control are to be made. You will see a number cf examples of this point in the discussion-material (1): to give one only, it was not till special laws had been made in the United States giving traders the right to come together in an organization, that it was possible for the International or &quot;World Copper Cartel&quot; to be formed. There are some here who are able to give a picture of the trouble of getting Lancashire cotton (f) producers into the sort of working organi&#172; zation which by common agreement is necessary for the development of a market for British goods in China. In the same way we have the example of the Stevenson system of rubber (f) control, which came to nothing because the Dutch government was unable in the end to keep control of the amount of rubber produced by the islanders in the Dutch East Indies. (2) There is another reason for giving attention to the trroup interests in different countries. Troubles of the sort which come to mind when we are talking about warring tendencies in international economic develop&#172; ment are generally seen to be between groups and not between private persons. The private person only comes into the picture when his posi&#172; tion is one of great power, so that he is more like a group than a private producer. This seems to me to be a good suggestion for testing how far, in the questions under discussion, there is truly a condition of economic v/ar and not simply one of normal competition. When any trouble has at the back of it some sort of group organization, then we have good reason for the belief that such a condition of economic war is present. This statement, naturally, is not complete without another, which I will give later. Possibly the best way to make my point clear is to take some of the examples of warring forces given in the discussion-material. Violent competition between producers within a country or even on an interna&#172; tional scale is no new thing, and in a general way it is probably true to (1) See American paper &quot;Introduction,&quot; p. 5.

            <essay:p>say that it is not a cause of serious trouble, because any one business in competition with others is only one small part of the complete organiza&#172; tion. But when these units are joined into groups such as shipping conferences or producers&apos; organizations, or even into great separate units like important oil (f) companies, then competition may well be given the name of war. Clearly, one reason for this is that a united group has a much greater chance of having some effect on its government, and of getting support for what it is doing. That takes me to the second rough test. It is that when the interests of a given group have got control of the political machine then there is1 good reason for a belief that the outcome of competition will frequently be economic war. One seemingly unimportant argument about trade com&#172; petition under these conditions will then take on a political color and may be the cause of a protest from government representatives. The processes of business competition in this way become something like a test of power between two governments. Examples of this are common enough and will frequently come to your attention in the conference. Competition between the shipping companies of different countries has been sharp at all times; but it becomes a question for government protest and bitter argument when it is seen that competition has some connection with government support. The commonest examples of this are loans of government money to shipping businesses. This, and the other and more roundabout forms of support given by the Japanese Government to shipowners and pro&#172; ducers is one of the chief causes of protest against the serious Japanese fcompetition which is giving so much trouble to English, Indian and American producers today. Those who have been against having normal relations with the government of Soviet Russia or making trade agree&#172; ments with that country have made it a chief point of attack that Soviet overseas trade (because it is completely in the hands of the Government) may be, and has been, made use of politically. A good example of the complex international troubles which come from this sort of thing may be seen very near us in the way in which the wheat (f) and lumber (f) interests of Canada were able to get the governments of Canada and England to put an end to the Trade Agreement between England and Russia. This uniting of business with political designs is* at the back of al&#172; most all the international troubles about tariffs (b) and has given numbers of examples of the sort of economic war I am attempting to give an account of; first, in the changes in U.S. tariffs in 1930, second in the agreements giving special rights to British countries at the Ottawa Con&#172; ference, and third, in the attack on Japanese trade in the new Indian tariff. You will see in the outline of the discussions that this uniting of political powers with business interests has been put forward as a possible way of grouping the different sorts of warring forces. In this way the sort of trouble which takes place in competition in private business is put right by private agreements and would come into one group, while those which have connections with government and in which political</essay:p>

            <essay:p>agreement is necessary would come in another; while a third group would be made up of troubles which go even deeper, needing special apparatus such as an international conference or an international committee of judges; and last there are the troubles on an international scale which are only ended by the use of force&#8212;as in boycotts and so on. FORMS OF CONTROL That is enough for the first heading. The Conference will not have much trouble in putting forward examples; but from the start it is neces^ sary to say quite clearly that doing this will have little effect if repre&#172; sentatives are not ready to give serious thought to the question of working out possible forms of control. When I say this, I am naturally taking the view that some sort of control is needed. There may be some who are not of this opinion and are ready to say that these warring forces are simply the natural outcome of necessary business competition, and that it is an error or even impossible to do anything in the hope of getting them under control. However, one has to have some point of view and so for the purposes of this paper I am taking it as certain that we are able to keep these forms of economic war under control, and that there is a need for us to do so. One reason for this view is that we have at all times had some sort of control, in one way or another. At all times governments have made certain rules in connection with business opera&#172; tions, and have frequently made a complete change in the business organization of a country by such things as tariff (b) laws and laws about working conditions and living conditions!. It is improbable that there has ever been a complete system of laissez-faire, (c) It is common knowledge that the Pacific is full of examplesi of control systems. If we take a look around the countries which have representatives here, we may well be surprised at the number of different forms of economic control which have been put into effect by the different governments. There is everything from the early attempts of the Jap&#172; anese government to give its support to its industry and trade (1), to its complete control over the tobacco (f) and camphor (f) industries and the still wider government control of overseas trade in Soviet Russia. We may put among these examples the attempts made from time to time in New Zealand and some parts of Australia at government control of business. These were on a small scale and were not part of a general economic plan, but designed to meet the needs of the times. With these may be grouped the different forms of control over certain goods like the unhappy Stevenson system of rubber-control, the operations of the grain marketing combine in Canada, the system of rice (f) control in Japan, the support given by the government of Australia to producers of sugar (f) and butter (f), and the New Zealand (2) control over fruit, butter and (1) See Moulton, &quot;Japan,&quot; Brooking&apos;s Institution, Washington, 1931.

            <essay:p>honey (f) produced for sale overseas. Even more important are the plans for wider economic control of the chief industries now being worked out by the American Government under the National Industrial Recovery Act. But all these are only representative of the more consciously planned forms of gcvernment control. At the back of them are the other forms of less planned control over economic operations, such as we see in tariffs, shipping laws, the control of immigration (d), the rules for keeping down the danger of disease from outside countries, laws con&#172; trolling the quality of food, etc. These roundabout ways of control may be most important. They have frequently been the cause of greater international ill-feeling than the more open forms of government control. Such things as the parts of Canadian tariff law (1) which make it possible to put any fixed exchange rate on the money of other countries are instruments of economic war which may frequently be the cause of serious outbursts of ill-feeling. Special committes of the League of Nations have had to give attention to a great number of such causes of international trouble. Under the cover of rules to keep disease out of a country it has frequently been possible for governments almost to put a stop to some parts of the trade of another country, in the same way as the very elastic rules for the control of immigration into Australia make it possible to keep anyone out by making him undergo a writing test in any language. In the same way, when one country in Europe, say Denmark, has a desire to keep out cows from Switzerland, it does not make a law against letting Swiss cows into the country, but makes a complex ruling to the effect that no cows which are kept at a higher level than 5,000 feet for more than three months of the year may be taken into Denmark. In working out systems of control there is much to be done in the discovery of how to put a stop to these small and foolish rules which get in the way of international trade. When we come to the wider field of international economic control we again see that the Pacific gives examples of a great number of differ&#172; ent system of control at present in existence. A short time back I said something about the system of rubber control attempted by the British government, which came to nothing. Another example of this sort is tlie system for the control of the output of tin (f), which is under the direction of a special international committee, and which has had better effects than the Stevenson plan. The details of its working are given in tbe British paper on &quot;Raw Materials in the Pacific&quot; (2). Less happy, it may be, but very important, are the shipping conferences which keep control of the rates for transport across the Pacific (3). Turning to those (1) Canadian Paper, 1933, p.p 28-29.

            <essay:p>plans for which the agreement and support of governments is necessary, we come face to face with the Ottawa (1) agreements of last year Though from the accounts we have at present it does not seem very probable that the effects of these agreements on Pacific trade will be very great, it is important to keep in mind that the Imperial Economic Conference is one form of international control which may quite possibly have serious effects on the natural currents of trade in the Pacific, and that though it is on a much greater scale than the organization of group interests inside one country, it may have within it the same seeds of trouble, be&#172; cause its chief purpose is not the well-being of all the Pacific countries but only a part of them. Possibly there is a parallel to the effects of Ottawa in the attempts of Japan to make a separate economic unit by a form of special control over the government of Manchuria (2). And if we give attention to this sort of system, we have, in addition, to take into account the other plan of international control which was put forward for Manchuria by the Lytton Commission, even though this seems to be farther away from current political ideas. We may go even farther and see what are the possible chances of forming special international com&#172; mittees for the control of certain fields of international economic opera&#172; tions. Of these, possibly the best example is Sir Arthur Salter&apos;s sugges&#172; tion, which he put forward at the London Conference on The State and Economic Life and at other times (1), for a fixed committee which would have control of overseas investment, and in addition, his plan for a legular international trade committee, not for controlling trade, but for making rules for the better working of, and competition in, international trade. Coming nearer to the Pacific, we have, in one of the papers given out at this Conference, Mr. Lorwin&apos;s design for a Pacific development committee which would have the same purpose. You will see that it is only possible to give serious attention to plans such as these on an international scale if we come to the question with a good knowledge of the working of the same sort of control systems in the different countries. No argument is necessary to make it clear that the experience of, for example, the American Department of Com&#172; merce or the British Empire Marketing Board, may be of great use in helping to get a good machine for international control. In the same way, the ill-feeling which was caused by the fact that the British Gov&#172; ernment did not take into account the interests of the American rubber industrie si when it was working out its system of control in Malaya makes one see the dangers to keep away from in future attempts at limiting output or controlling markets. Before I come to the end of this part of my statement, may I put before you one important point about the present system of control.

            <essay:p>point is that most of them have been designed only in relation to the needs of the time, or in the interests of some special group in one country. In the same way, a number of other systems of control have come to birth only in bad times, and business groups have been united by such conditions as a great fall of prices or a loss of markets. Clearly there is great danger in having overmuch hope in the future of such systems of control. The trouble of shutting out outside competition in any plan for limiting output or controling prices even in one country is common knowledge. The dangers of the system are far greater when those who take part come from different nations!. Again, we might take the different wartime controls as examples of what might be done. But here again it is important to keep in mind that these controls were designed for pur&#172; poses very different from those we have now. And last, I might say&#8212; though it is quite unnecessary for one to go into details in this company&#8212; that to make a chance selection from among the different and independent systems with little relation between them, would be a very different thing from working out a well-made system for international control. From what I have said it seems probable that you will see that the most important part of our discussions will have to do with control. If that is so, then it seems! to me that it is not possible to do much without having a clear idea of the ends, at least in our minds, for which this control is to be used. Possbily one such end may be enough: possibly more will be needed. But in my opinion it is necessary for usi to have some sort of purpose cearly before us in our discussionsi of control. The end in view may be to give all countries equal trading right: or the idea of a society in which all men are equal: or that of the greatest possible self-development of men and women. It is not necessary for this end to be fixed from the start, so that it may not be changed. Discussions started in that way do not generally get past the first argument which comes up. It is for this reason that the Program Committee has made a lequest to the round-tables not to come to the question with fixed ideas, but simply to give attention to the present systems of control, keeping any decision of ends till the last. THE POLITICAL SIDE OF CONTROL I take up now what will be the second part of the round table dis&#172; cussions; that is, the question of international adjustment. It will be the work of the round tables when this question comes up to see how far the present system of international organization is of use for the control of the warring interests about which I have been talking; to see bow far political conditions in a country or the existence of agreements&apos; be&#172; tween countries may be a help or the opposite in getting a balance be&#172; tween group interest; and last, to see what new appartus is possible, or what changes in the old, in the interest of peace and the good of society. Even if this was simply an economic conference&#8212;which it is not&#8212; it would be necessary to give some attention to these political questions, because economic forces are not acting in a separate field but through</essay:p>

            <essay:p>the present forms of our political organization,&#8212;in fact it is frequently simply cnance which makes us say that a given trouble is political or economic. It may be dependent on how far the special business interest in question is ready to make use of normal business adjustments, such as price agreements, combines or the putting up of branch industries in other countries, or how far they make use of the power of the nation by forcing the government&apos;s hand, and so getting what is desired in more roundabout ways, such as tariff agreements, the limiting of markets, and the investment of money in other countries. I am pointing out that there are these two ways of making adjust&#172; ments because you may then see that it is necessary for all forms of international adjustment to be made through governments. Cartels have made international agreements in which governments have had no part, and these are quite as important as trade agreements made by the usual government representatives in different countries. In the same way, the distribution of Far Eastern markets as worked out by, say, the Shell and Standard Oil Companies among themselves is an adjustment no less important than a government agreement undertaking to keep the &quot;Open Door&quot; in these places. In fact, it is possible that a number of interna&#172; tional troubles might be put right more smoothly if agreements were made between the business interests in question, for example, between the Malayan rubber producers and the American tyre (f) industry, than by the much more complex process of government decision and protests. One thing which would give support to this view is the way in which there has been a tendency among American business groups to give greater value to the more elastic sort of adjustment which is possible in a private committee of judges than to the slower process of going to law. However that may be, we will do well to keep in mind that probably the greater part of all troubles and agreements between nations^&#8212;those which are said to&lt; be economic no less than those which are political&#8212; are in fact put straight by the normal process of discussion between government representatives. For this reason, it is part of the first busi&#172; ness of the &apos;Round-Tables&apos; to see how well these normal processes of adjustments are working and specially, to see how far there is any hope that they will be of use for the special troubles of the present day which more and more take a complex economic form. Clearly one question which will come up here is that of how far the consuls and government representatives generally are in the right position to be responsible for this sort of discussions. The amount of special international apparatus which was put into effect after the war is a sign that the normal organi&#172; zation is not quite what is needed for meeting the questions we are faced with today. In addition to the international agreements of which I have been talking, in which the government has no part, we have had a great number of international conferences taking place in connection with special questions. Some are on the scale of the World Economic Confer&#172; ence in London; others are limited to smaller groups of nations, such as</essay:p>

            <essay:p>the conference of the Danubian countries; others have to do with special goods of one sort or another, like the present conference of the wheat- producing countries. The World Court, the League of Nations, and the International Labour Office, are representative of another side of this apparatus for adjustment; and different again, is the international net&#172; work of trade agreementsv most of which have some connection with the &apos;Most Favoured Nation Clause (e)&apos;. The experience of the Conference on the State and Economic Life which took place in London in May gives one the idea that even a discussion of the effect of the existence of &apos;Most Favoured Nation&apos; agreements in the Pacific countries will give much light on the question of how well the present organization of government rela&#172; tions with one another is working out. (1). The Conference will no doubt be interested to get an opinion from the experts who are present as to why certain sorts of international agreements, such as those in connection with posts, radio and telegrams have been working more or less smoothly, while others have been hard to put into operation, or have even been dropped completely. In addition they will probably be interested in hear&#172; ing why an adjustment committee working as part of the normal system, like the Canadian-American Border Commission, has a long and good record, while a suggestion as made at earlier Institute Conferences to have this sort of committee in connection with the same questions of adjustment in Manchuria has1 had no support from the political authorities. You will frequently see that the reasons why certain sorts of inter&#172; national organization have not been of great use is not because there is anything wrong with the plans themselves, but because the conditions in one or more of the countries do. not make it possible for those countries to put into operation their part of the agreement. If this is so, it seems that one good line of discussion for the &apos;Round-Tables&apos; to take up would be that of looking into those political conditions in the different Pacific countries which have a tendency to get in the way of plans for interna&#172; tional adjustment. Some of these are common knowledge. The laws in the United States about forming business combines have for a long time made it hard for that country to take part in such an international agree&#172; ment as the World Copper Cartel, and even now it is only possible for it to do so because of a very free reading of the Webb Pomerene Act. (2) The existence of state&apos;s rights, as separate from the rights of the nation as a unit is another fact which has kept back the development of these plans of international organization in the United: States, Canada and Australia. In a different sense the new relations between the countries of the British Commonwealth after the Ottawa Conference may keep them from taking part freely in outside international agreements, though how great the effect of this will be is still uncertain. The Manchurian trouble has given a clearer example of this point. On the one hand there (1) See the paper &quot;The State and Economic Life,&quot; Institute of Intellectual Co-operation,&quot; Paris, June 1933. (2) American paper &quot;Government Promotion of Foreign Trade in the United States,&quot; p.p 20-31.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>is a school with the belief that because the Chinese government has so little control of certain parts of the country it is impossible to make international agreements with that country which will be of any use; and on the other hand, there are those who take the view that the organization of the Japanese Government under which the military is outside the control of the Cabinet is equally responsible for the trouble. If we go still farther into this question, it is possible to see that a great number of new points may come up because of the existence of a government which has not general international support, such as that of Manchuria. The normal answer, when points of this sort are made, is that these are private questions to do with the separate countries and that it is wrong to have international discussions on them. Clearly, if this was the general opinion about all such questions, we would be unable to go forward at all, and it would not be possible to make any international agreements of value. Happily, in a conference like this, the idea that special interests touching one nation are the business of that nation only will not have such general respect as it has in the Geneva meetings where government representatives take part, and there is some chance that suggestions of great value for the future may be made. . CONTROL AND EDUCATION I have said that economic forces are not limited to a special field but that their operation takes place within a given form of political struc&#172; ture. For a completely true statement we will have to go farther and say that they are, in fact, a part of the very structure of society. In these days any attempt on the part of some business group to get special rights or on the part of the Government to put into operation some new instrument of political control, is dependent for its outcome on getting the support of public opinion. For this reason the education of public opinion is one question which has necessarily to come into any suggestion loi economic and political control. Here, then, is one reason for having in our discussion list a heading on education. Let me once more make it clear that these discussions are not simply a sort of side-line of the Banff Conference; and they are not put in simply to make a connection with the discussions of the 1935 conference. They are in fact an important part of our present discussion. Most of you will see that there will come to light in the first week&apos;s discussion in this Conference a number of examples of tendencies which aie out of harmony with one another in our general values or what might be looked on as the field of education. Sometimes it may take the form of two opposite ideas about education as seen, say, in the school system cf my own country. At other times, there may be a bad adjustment between current economic tendencies and current theories of education. And almost everywhere in our discussions we will see signs of the fact which had been so frequently noted, that public opinion and ideas of education are unable to keep up with the quickly changing conditions of economic development.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>When I say education I naturally have in mind not simply the teach&#172; ing given in schools and universities, but that wider and, possibly, more important education which goes on through the newspaper, the motion picture, the radio, and public statements. It is important to keep in mind the fact that these two ways of education may be very different and a great cause of trouble in this field because they have different theories at the back of them and are working to different ends. It seems unnecessary to give examples. In the teaching of schools and universities much weight may be put on the good effects of free international relations and the value of the arts and learning of other countries; while at the same time the full force of a nation&apos;s newspapers and other public opinion forming groups may be used to give the idea of &quot;my country right or wrong.&quot; An example of this is that all the econ&#172; omic experts of a nation may make protests against a new tariff law wihout having the least effect on what t&apos;he government does. In discussions of such questions of education it has been the experience of the Institute that two different views quickly come to light in the round tables. On one side there are those&#8212;generally not teachers&#8212;to whom the question seems to be the way in which different business groups are attempting to get control of public opinion for their private interests. This group naturally sees the question as one of decisions! about the government control of news, or the degree to which the outlook of newspaper-writers is changed by their desire to get advertisementsv or the use of the instruments of public educationfor the support of one poitical group. To them the chief question seems to be the working out of some system for controlling these forces, which are against the general interests of society. For those who see the question from this angle, there will be much material for attention. It is common knowledge that there is control of news in the Pacific. Sometimes it is done openly by the government; sometimes by special business interests working in more roundabout ways. In some countries the great businesses have a very strong grip on the operation of news services, radio and telegraphs. The other line of attack is quite different. A number of persons, and among them most experts on education, see the process as&gt; something much deeper than the conscious attempts at changing public opinion by businessi interests. In their view, what is important is the way in which the attempts at control are themselves changed because of the existence of the present framework of society and because of past history; and their interest is in seeing how these slower moving forces of education, which are forming the general outlook of the public may be used against group interests which are making attemptsi at forming public opinion; or, even better, to see that no profit comes from such attempts, because they are not able to get the attention and approval of society. It will be clear then, that these two lines of attack will have their supporters in the Banff Conference, and the two will, in fact, be used. If that is so, let us come now to the six questions which have been put</essay:p>

            <essay:p>down as a rough guide to the discussions on education. Possibly the firsit which will come to the front is that of seeing how far the bad economic adjustments of the Pacific are made worse by the systems and theories of education in the different countries. How far, for example, would a suggestion for forming a sort of international marketing com&#172; mittee be taken seriously in our country when, for years, an idea had been fixed in the public mind that it was impossible to let any outside nation have anything to do with the way our goods were put on the market. The second question puts before us a trouble which is very common&#8212; that of getting an adjustment between processes of education and the economic conditions of the time. The sort of wrong adjustment which is seen so frequently in the overproducing of &quot;white collar workers&quot; is one important part of this. It is seen not only in countries in a high stage of economic development, but equally (and possibly with more damaging effects) in colonies which are at a low level of economic development. In such places, though the government has the very best desire to help, thousands of persons are being given an education which will put them completely out of touch with their older beliefs and ways of living, and at the same time, give them no place in the new society, simply because there are not enough openings for the sort of work for which they have been trained. The other side of this same question might be put as the discovery of how far this need of a better adjustment in education might be put right by a changed system of education designed to keep in existence (at least for the present), a number of the old ways of working and living, which have been of economic value in the past. For example if it is impossible to get the right sort of work in great towns for all the young Chinese or Filipino men and and women who have had an education, it may be possible to give them some work by the development of certain farming or hand industries which have come down from the past. I make that statement without being certain that it would have much value, because unhappily most of our experience makes it seem that these attemptsi to keep old ways of industry and handwork in existence have had very little effect in the long run. And it is my opinion that the round-table representatives will be interested in working out the reasons why this is so, and in putting forward an answer which goes deeper into the causes of the trouble. In the field of education, as in that of economics, my belief is that no discussion of these questions will be of any great value till representa&#172; tives have in their minds a clear idea of the form of society we are working for. If this is not done we have no certain way of measuring the different suggestions against one another. To put such a system of values into words or to come to a decision, say, on how far it is right for the private person to be the servant of a nation, or of a special group in a nation, or how far it is right for the new organization to be based on the free development of every man and woman, is work for which I have not the necessary training. But we are happy in having a number</essay:p>

            <essay:p>FOREWORD The following essay on the relevance of land utilization studies to the Institute&apos;s program of research and to international relations may be regarded as an introduction to the task of coordinating land utili&#172; zation studies in the Pacific area, entrusted by the International Re&#172; search Committee to Dr. Carl L. Alsberg, a Director of the Food Research Institute, Stanford University. From the inception of its research program, the Institute has devoted major attention to studies in this field. The two largest projects, those in China and Japan, have extended over a six-year period; somewhat smaller studies in land utilization have been, or are being, carried out in Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Korea. Related study projects in agricultural practices and policies, entrusted to the Stanford Food Research Institute with funds from other sources, are also under way. Certain countries not included in the scope of the Institute&apos;s land utilization studies, such as the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands East Indies, have already been adequately investigated by governmental agencies or other research bodies. With this extensive program of Institute studies in separate coun&#172; tries and the investigations already completed by other institutions in other countries, the International Research Committee, during its meetings at the time of the China Conference in 1931, voted funds for a study which would coordinate into a comprehensive report the findings of these several inquiries. Delay in the completion of cer&#172; tain national studies has suggested the wisdom of postponing the coordinating project until the results of more separate investigations are at hand. In the meantime, however, Dr. Alsberg has prepared the following paper in order to indicate the importance and relation of land utilization studies to the discussion of international economic relations. Although these pages are recommended for study in connection with the forthcoming Banff Conference, the Institute does not assume responsibility for statements of fact or opinion con&#172; tained in them.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>land utilization investiga&#172; tions and their bearing on international relations IT IS not so long ago that most men saw no large role for agricul&#172; ture to play in the shaping of national policy. When, in 1887, it was proposed to establish a ministry of agriculture in the United States, Attorney-General Garland prepared a memorandum on the subject for President Cleveland, in which the following passage occurs: &quot;The Cabinet is in session, and after the usual call upon the officials for anything they wish to submit, the President says: &apos;Mr. Colman,1 have you anything to submit?&apos; Mr. Colman: &apos;Yes, sir, I have quite a number of letters discussing the question whether it is best to plant potatoes in the dark or the light of the moon, and many inquiries as to whether the black land is better for cotton than the red sandy soil, and whether the South-down sheep is adapted down South or up North, etc&apos; These now are about fair samples of the matters that would come before the Cabinet from that de&#172; partment. Now, what on earth has the government to do with these?&quot;2 And this was written at a time when agriculture in America was suffering so severely from low prices that farmers were joining mine owners in the campaign for the free and unlimited coinage of silver that led ultimately to the nomination of William Jennings Bryan for the presidency in 1896. In some countries, this type of attitude prevailed for a long time&#8212;indeed, in some of them, until the Great War compelled the establishment of ministries for agri&#172; culture. Even today, the average man does not clearly understand the ways in which departments of agriculture may, and often do, contribute to the shaping of both internal and external national policies. Of these ways, none is more important than the investiga- 1 Colman was at that time U. S. Commissioner of Agriculture. 2 Garland to Cleveland, March (no day), 1887. Cleveland Papers.

            <essay:p>tion of land utilization, which forms the basis for land-utilization policies. The purpose of this essay is to set forth the nature of land- utilization investigations and to show how the findings of such investigations may be used to influence the relations between peoples and nations. The term land utilization is rather new, although there is nothing new about the subject. Land-utilization studies of one sort or another have long been made. Indeed, the science known as agron&#172; omy is really the study of the use of land in all its aspects, but agronomists have stressed primarily the technique of treating the land rather than the economic aspects of land use. In America, and in some other countries, the term agronomy came to be re&#172; stricted to the more purely technological aspect of the subject. Later, with the rising interest in agricultural economics, the need was felt for a term that had not acquired a restricted meaning as the word agronomy had in America. Students began to use the term land utilization, or land use, which had not yet come to have any very definite meaning. Since, in America, such students were mostly interested in economic aspects of the use of land, these terms have come to imply the economic aspects of the use of land, just as the term agronomy had earlier come to be limited largely to the technological aspects of the use of land. The sorts of studies, then, with which we shall be concerned, are primarily economic studies of the use of land. However, land uses cannot be investigated without a good deal of consideration of the technological aspects of the problem, that is of agronomy; nor can clarity be achieved without regard for social and political conse&#172; quences of the use that is made of land. Regard for these conse&#172; quences controls the point of view from which land-utilization studies are made. They may take the point of view of the individual farmer, or of a given area, or of a nation as a whole. As a matter of fact, students are engaged upon all three types of inquiries, but not all types are classed as land-utilization investiga&#172; tions. Some of them are known as farm-management studies; others, as studies in agricultural policy. The use of land on a particular farm or group of similar farms is studied for the purpose of indicating to the farmers how they, individually, may improve their economic position; however, in</essay:p>

            <essay:p>America, such studies are not classed as land-utilization studies, but rather as farm-management investigations. Farm-management study is analogous to the study of efficiency in factory management. Both seek to improve the economic condition of individuals without con&#172; cerning themselves with the question whether or not improvement in that condition is gained at the expense of other elements of the population. Since conditions in a given region, though varying somewhat from farm to farm, present certain uniformities of climate, topog&#172; raphy, and soil, studies are also made dealing not with individual farms alone but with groups of farms. The purpose is to discover general principles applicable to the area as a whole. The problem is then conceived as the determination of the best method of utilizing a given agricultural area. This is the type of investigation that typically&#8212;at least in America&#8212;is regarded as the study of land utilization. For the most part, the objective is to improve the eco&#172; nomic condition of an area or of a class of farmers; and students do not always concern themselves with the question whether or not the procedures recommended are in the interest of the nation as a whole. Land Studies and National Policy If the investigator&apos;s aim is the general economic welfare of the nation as a whole, he must view the varied uses of the nation&apos;s land as a whole. He must integrate all the separate land-utilization inves&#172; tigations. He will soon realize that the uses of land in different regions lead to competition of these regions with one another. It will be clear to him that the uses of land greatly influence the welfare not merely of individual farmers, not merely of regional groups of farmers, but of all other elements of the population as well, whether they be engaged in industry, in commerce, in the profes&#172; sions, or in the government services. He will search for those uses of land that promote the economic welfare not of individual farmers alone, not of specific agricultural regions alone, but of the people of the country as a whole. He will try to determine what agricul&#172; tural policy is in the general interest and likely to achieve the greatest economic welfare, not of individuals, groups, or classes, but in the aggregate. In reaching his conclusions, he will take into considera-</essay:p>

He is, then, studying certain aspects of na&#172; tional agricultural policy.3 Thus, Gray defines land utilization as &quot;that branch of land eco&#172; nomics which comprises the study of the land resources of a nation or other geographical unit from the standpoint of their economic significance with a view to determining for what and how they may be most effectively employed.&quot;4 Land-utilization studies must be based upon farm-management policy on the one hand, and upon national policy on the other; the best use of land depends in part upon the character of the national policy for agriculture. Obviously, one must know how all the vari&#172; ous sorts of land of a nation may be utilized, if one is to make an in&#172; telligent choice of policy. There may be, and usually are, alternative uses for land, and it is necessary to make a choice among them. Nevertheless, many nations have evolved agricultural policies by dealing with each situation as it arose rather than by deciding in advance upon a well-defined plan based on land-utilization and other investigations; sometimes the country does not even realize that it has a policy. A policy thus arrived at need not be that most de&#172; sirable in the general interest. One might take the Union of South Africa as an example of the dependence of policy upon alternative uses of land. The greater part of the country is semi-arid. Some of it is fit only for pasturage; some of it can be used for pasturage, for grain farming or for fodder crops. Some small portion of it is humid enough for fruit culture and mixed farming.5 The alternative uses of much of the land of the Union of South Africa would seem to be animal husbandry and grain farming. These alternatives limit the range of choice of 3 The term policy is here used, not to designate a short-term program, but in the sense in which it has been defined by Black, thus: &quot;The term &apos;policy&apos; implies a more or less carefully considered and fundamental course of action followed consistently for a period of years.&quot; John D.

This is being recognized, as witness the recent creation in America of the National Land Use Planning Committee and the National Advisory and Legislative Committee on Land Use. Their objective is not to study the use of land from the viewpoint of individual areas or of individual farmers, but from the viewpoint of the welfare of the United States as a whole. The Land Utilization Survey of Britain, established in 1932, has similar objectives. Special Needs for Land Studies in New Countries Land utilization needs to be studied intensively, especially in new countries. Such studies are capable of preventing many mistakes, un&#172; necessary hardships, wastes, and human tragedies that accompany the advancement of the frontier with its pioneer fringe. &quot;If land always at once found the uses at which it has comparative advan&#172; tage, there would be no need for any land-utilization studies.&quot;6 Often, land is not put to the most advantageous use, &quot;because the utilizers of it do not know enough about its natural qualities, about the regions with which it must compete for a market, and about the nature of the demand of the various products to which it might be devoted; because they fail to foresee the changes that will take place in competition and demand; and because of the time it takes to shift to a new use even after it is recognized as needed.&quot;7 In old countries, by a process of trial and error extending over centuries, the most advantageous uses of land have usually been discovered. In a new country, this needs to be done by a speedier method than trial and error. Therefore, in them one turns to land-utilization research. In a new country with unoccupied farm land, no wise immigra&#172; tion policy can be devised unless the potentialities of the land are understood, for these determine the conditions under which people can be induced to go upon the land and remain there. Few countries want immigration to their cities, for there the newcomer either un- 6 Research in Agricultural Land Utilization, Scope and Method, edited by J. D.

Land Studies in Old Countries It would be a mistake, however, to assume that in old countries there is no place for land-utilization investigations. In them, also, there is interest in land utilization, but for different reasons. Old countries are commonly more or less densely populated, like Japan or Germany. They may not be producing all the food they con&#172; sume, or they may be merely tending toward increasing importation of foodstuffs. In some of them, the old and tried methods of land utilization are no longer adequate to feed the people; food must be, or there is prospect that it will have to be, imported as population grows. Therefore, studies are made to determine whether new ways of using the land may not be more effective in producing food than the old, customary ones. Often, it is not merely a matter of using in improved ways land already in agricultural use, but also of bringmg waste land into cultivation either by irrigation works, or by drainage, or by con&#172; trolling rivers to prevent overflow. The decision regarding the ad&#172; visability of such public works is not merely a question of engineer&#172; ing or finance; it is equally a question of land utilization and of population growth. Whether it is wise to bring new land into culti&#172; vation depends, among other considerations, upon whether popula- 8 Isaiah Bowman, The Pioneer Fringe (American Geographical Society Special Pub&#172; lication No. 13), 1931, p. 85. 9R.

            <essay:p>tion is increasing, stationary, or decreasing; also whether the result is worth the cost and effort of reclamation. The economic, and espe&#172; cially the agricultural economic, aspects of such proposals are too often neglected. For example, the cost of flood prevention on the lower Mississippi River will come to $50.00 per acre, and yet no economic study has been made to determine if this is warranted.10 Such an economic study, if made, would have to be based in part upon land-utilization study. Furthermore, the proper evaluation of great public works requires consideration of their effects upon the utilization of land. For example, the projected Great Lakes- St. Lawrence Tidewater Waterway admittedly will affect profoundly the way in which farm lands will be used; yet, so far as the printed record shows, neither the Canadian nor the United States government has made competent scientific study of this question. The only serious studies of this sort have been made outside the government services.11 Even in old, stable countries, well able to feed themselves at home, land-use studies are not out of place; they would be only in a static world or in one in which there is no world trade. In a world that is continuously evolving, that is opening up new lands, that is pro&#172; gressing in technology with giant strides, that through its very progress is creating obsolescence in all the means of production, the farmer as well as the manufacturer must reckon with ever-shifting conditions. A system of farming that may have been advantageous in one decade may become disadvantageous in another, because of new inventions or changes in transportation or new competition from other regions or changes in social organization, etc., etc. In older countries, land-utilization studies become of prime importance in periods of rapid economic change. Invention and Land Utilization It may perhaps be worth while at this stage of our analysis to pause to present a few examples of the effects of social and tech&#172; nological changes upon the utilization of land.

            <essay:p>passage of a society from a barter to a money economy stimulates invention, perhaps because a money economy favors specialization and division of labor. If a man only occasionally uses a tool, it may not be worth his while to improve it. If, however, he uses the tool constantly and depends upon it for his living, as he does when he becomes a specialist, he has every incentive to invent a better one. Invention is something that cannot be foreseen. Edgar Allan Poe put it many years ago thus: &quot;The history of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral, or incidental, or acci&#172; dental events we are indebted for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries, that it has at length become necessary, in any prospective view of improvement, to make not only large, but the largest, allowances for inventions that shall arise by chance, and quite out of the range of ordinary expectation. It is no longer philosophical to base, upon what has been, a vision of what is to be. Accident is admitted as a portion of the substructure.&quot;12 One cannot foresee what new tools or what new devices may come into use to make possible the better utilization of land already in cultivation or the utilization of land not already in use. The auto&#172; mobile has immensely widened the margin of agricultural land. The light automobile of the Ford type has, for example, made possible the commercial production of cecas over vast regions of West Africa.13 In a new country today, the problem is not simply how rail&#172; roads can be built to tap its resources, but also whether it is better to build a large mileage of cheap motor roads or a smaller mileage of costly railroad. The introduction of drain tile has vastly extended the area of heavy land that can be plowed. One wonders whether, if drain tiles had been introduced long since in tropical and subtropical Asia, rice would now be so nearly exclusively the backbone of agriculture there. Liebig and Hellriegel, through the introduction of fertilizer, con&#172; quered more plow land for the German people than Frederick the 12 E. A.

            <essay:p>Great and Bismarck combined.14 And the same may be said of Haber and the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. The introduction of the sugar beet has in some localities reduced the value of hay land, because in addition to the beets it furnishes much fodder. The law of diminishing returns takes on a new aspect when the increment of work applied to the land is that of machine labor&#8212; especially, if it means a more intensive crop.15 Land Utilization and Social Change The mere raising of the standard of living renders some of the land in cultivation submarginal. Whether a given piece of land is or is not marginal depends upon the standard of living of the farmer who cultivates it. He will farm it only if he is enabled thereby to maintain his standards. If his standards rise, as they are bound to do if the general standard of living of the country rises, and if upon his farm he is unable to maintain his standards at the now higher level, he abandons his farm. For him, it has become submarginal. In rapidly developing countries and especially in times of great social changes, maladjustments in the use of land occur for social as well as for technological reasons. The purpose of land-utilization studies is to remedy maladjust&#172; ments in the use of land from whatever cause they may arise. It is not astonishing, therefore, that in the post-war period there has been greater interest in land-utilization studies than ever before; the war caused all sorts of maladjustment&#8212;in agriculture no less than elsewhere. The war led to an immensely sharpened post-war com&#172; petition among farmers. In belligerent countries, agricultural pro&#172; duction was reduced during the war, so that distant regions had to be drawn upon to make good the deficit. In consequence, agricul&#172; tural production was stimulated in most of the newer countries, for they were at peace. One form this stimulation took was the sub&#172; stitution of machines for draught animals, with the release of a large acreage for food crops that had theretofore been used for feed crops. In most of the old countries at war with one another, agriculture 14 F.

            <essay:p>became disorganized. When peace came and the war-stricken coun&#172; tries were able again to turn to farming, they had the opportunity to rationalize their disorganized agriculture on a more effective basis than before the war. Indeed, they were compelled to change their agricultural organization to meet the changed conditions growing out of the stimulus the war had given to agriculture in the newer countries. These newer countries also found it necessary to give attention to their agricultural organization; for, as farming in the war-stricken countries recovered, the new countries found the mar&#172; kets for their new expanded farming restricted. Competition was sharpened on all sides, and farmers had to become more efficient if they were to continue in commercial farming. But to become more efficient, they had to learn to use their lands to the best pos&#172; sible advantage. To this end, land-utilization studies are basic. Hence, everywhere in recent decades, in old countries as well as in new, there has been growing interest in land-utilization investi&#172; gations. South Africa&#8212;an Illustration It is obvious, then, that land-utilization studies furnish basic mate&#172; rial without which it would be difficult to formulate wise new agri&#172; cultural policies or modify old ones. Let us illustrate by a specific example, and for that purpose let us turn again to the case of the Union of South Africa, because it is perhaps the simplest to be found. As we have seen, much of the land, except certain limited humid areas along the seaboard, may be used either for the rearing of animals or for growing grain. Therefore, the question of policy for the Union of South Africa is: Should the country produce the maximum of grain possible or the maximum of animal products? If the former, then the humid regions should be devoted to fruit culture for export and to mixed farming, the dry regions to grain farming principally and to animal husbandry only in so far as grain farming is not practicable. The government would favor grain growers by tariffs or otherwise, and would take all feasible steps to encourage dry-land farming.

Its road- and railroad-construction policy would be to build a network sufficiently fine-meshed to furnish transportation to market to as many grain farmers as possible. If, on the contrary, the policy adopted is to produce the maximum of animal products, then the humid regions would be devoted to growing fruit for export and concentrated feeding stuffs to &quot;finish&quot; for the market the livestock produced in the more arid regions. The semi-arid regions would be devoted primarily to pasturage and to the growing of fodder crops. The government would not expend large sums in irrigation works. It would not raise tariffs on maize, wheat, or other dry-land crops. It would not place obstacles in the way of holding land in tracts large enough for stock ranges. Its policy in regard to road and railroad building would be adapted to the needs of a very extensive form of agriculture. Its scientific work would be directed rather toward the improvement of pastures, of feed crops, and of the breeds of animals, than toward the improve&#172; ment of food crops.16 If the Union of South Africa is to become a grain-exporting coun&#172; try primarily, her place in the world&apos;s economy will be other than if she is to be an exporter of animal products. Her tariff policy will be different, obviously. Her immigration policy and her treatment of the native will be different also, for grain growing requires more labor than animal husbandry. In short, her orientation toward the rest of the world, at least so far as her agricultural activities influence that orientation, will be profoundly influenced by the agricultural policy she adopts, and this policy depends in large measure upon the use of land. Land Utilization and Foreign Policy It must now be obvious to the reader that agricultural policy is one of the determinants of a country&apos;s foreign policy. Conversely, for&#172; eign policy is one of the determinants of agricultural policy and, in consequence, of land utilization. For example, if a country seeks to be self-sufficient, clearly this policy must largely influence its agricultural and land-utilization policy; but the policy necessary to 16Leppan, op. cit.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>achieve self-sufficiency with respect to agriculture will be different according as the country is densely or thinly populated. Thinly populated countries, like the United States, Canada, and Australia, are usually exporters of foodstuffs and raw materials. Their interest in land utilization is not based on the desire to be self-sufficient in regard to food; as a rule, they are not merely self- sufficient but producers of surpluses beyond their own needs&#8212; except for special products, such as tea, coffee, sugar, spices, and the like. They tend to erect tariff barriers only against some of the agricultural raw materials in respect to which they are importers&#8212; and they do so for the purpose of encouraging production at home. Or they encourage domestic production by bounties and other sub&#172; ventions. The main objective of their land policies is to produce at low cost so that they may compete with other exporting countries in the markets of the world. Their efforts are not directed toward bringing into cultivation the greatest area possible, but rather to specialize in the production of such crops as can be produced at suffi&#172; ciently low cost to compete successfully on the markets of the world. Their problem is rather to restrict the production of export crops to such lands as are capable of producing these crops at low cost and to find uses for the other lands on which the export crops can be produced only at costs too high to compete in world markets. The problem is to find domestic uses for such land, since its high-cost product cannot compete on world markets. This involves the use of such land for grazing or for the growing of timber. But such coun&#172; tries are always tempted to deal with the situation by artificial means. Agricultural tariffs help little, since these countries export agricultural products. They are tempted to keep marginal land in the production of crops for export by one form or another of subsidy, such as bounties, export premiums, and the like. Land Utilization and Population Pressure Densely populated countries are of two types: those with a highly developed economic structure and those with a more or less primitive one. Those of the first type, if they do not seek to b&gt;e self-sufficient, may encourage the importation of agricultural products in order to be in a favorable position to manufacture for export. If, on the contrary, they seek to be self-sufficient with respect to their food</essay:p>

            <essay:p>supply, they tend to erect tariff barriers or to grant subsidies in order to keep high-cost producers of foodstuffs in production. Their use of land seeks to effect the maximum volume of product, which often seems to them more important than to produce at low cost. They tend not to concentrate upon those agricultural commodities that can be produced at low cost, but to attempt to produce foodstuffs and to bring under cultivation the last possible bit of land. They tend to erect tariff barriers against the food and other agricultural products they produce domestically, in order that their price level may be high and that, in consequence, the maximum amount may be produced at home. Thereby, they tend to raise the cost of living and, therefore, the level of money wages (though not real wages) and to make it more difficult for their industries to work for export. The second type of densely populated country, that with a primi&#172; tive economic structure, practices subsistence farming, and, there&#172; fore, is self-sufficient with regard to agricultural products. Such countries may be regarded as neutrals, in so far as their agriculture has an influence on international relations. In subsistence farming, each family or village produces all or nearly all that it needs. The commodities produced are sold only to a very slight extent, though they may be bartered locally for other produce. In such a com&#172; munity or country, there is but little division of labor or specializa&#172; tion. Here, there is no apparent need for land-utilization studies. The subsistence farmer produces everything that he needs. He seeks, of course, to produce with as little effort as possible, but since he does not sell, he does not compete with other farmers; and it is, therefore, less important to him whether his costs are high or low. Efficiency in production is low, for it lacks the efficiency that comes from division of labor and exchange of products. Standards of living, in consequence, are low. In such communities, development of division of labor results, of necessity, in the production of an in&#172; creased quota of wealth, with the possibility of a more extensive satisfaction of wants and a rise in the standard of living. With the development of division of labor, subsistence farming gradually is replaced by cash-crop farming, in which the farmer produces for sale, whether in the domestic or in the world market. It involves the production of whatever can be produced at lowest cost, and its exchange, through the medium of money, for other commodities</essay:p>

            <essay:p>produced by other farmers who can produce those commodities at low cost. Land-utilization studies, then, become more important. Land Uses in Tropical Dependencies Many of the tropical dependencies of advanced countries are, so far as the indigenes are concerned, in the state of subsistence farm&#172; ing. The policy of the controlling power has made for specialization, but not by natives. It is characteristic of most of these countries that, when they first came under the sway of the colonizing power, they were relatively thinly populated. There were large stretches of arable land which had not been brought under the plow at all. Spe&#172; cialization in agriculture, therefore, took the form of creating plan&#172; tations on these wild lands. There were, of course, exceptions to this policy, for example in British West Africa and in Java in the days of the Dutch East India Company and for some decades after its liquida&#172; tion. As a rule, in countries in which the plantation system is intro&#172; duced in the manner above outlined, the native does not for a long time specialize or practice division of labor to any marked degree. He remains a subsistence farmer; he continues to grow his food crops whether or not his land is better suited to the production of some other crop which he might sell for more than enough to cover the purchase of his needs. The native, then, in a country in which division of labor has been achieved and an export market developed by the establishment of plantations with European management, tends only slowly to raise his efficiency and productivity through spe&#172; cialization which has been at the bottom of most forms of material progress in the last century or more. He is ordinarily unable to produce a surplus for sale, and in consequence has nothing left over to raise his standard of living, except, possibly, what he may achieve as a worker upon nearby plantations. His condition is the direct result of the land-utilization policy of the colonizing power. It is often urged that the native is too unintelligent and backward to see the advantage of specialization in agricultural production. That this is, in fact, true is very greatly to be questioned. The native is quite as quick to see where he can make a profit as anyone else. Very generally when he refuses to change his ways it is because he fails to see the benefit to him in such a change. Or, it may be that the change involves capital outlays or, what comes to the same thing,</essay:p>

            <essay:p>the storage and holding of products which he, practically lacking capital, is not in a position to make. The principal credit system for the peasants of Java is the government pawnshop; the average loan is less than five guilders ($2.00 gold) . The cooperative village banks on Java average loans of less than 25 guilders. If it is said that the native is improvident and does not save and accumulate capital, one must have in mind the psychology of saving. Saving means present sacrifice and foregoing the satisfaction of a want or need with the expectation, thereby, of satisfying a need in the future. Therefore, whether or not anyone&#8212;white, black, yel&#172; low, red, or brown&#8212;saves depends on the felt intensity of the present need in comparison with the future need. It is this ratio which, though imponderable, determines whether one saves. It follows that, the lower the standard of living of the individual, the less is he likely to save, for the simple reason that his present wants will be the more intense the less he has at the moment. The Malay who, with his family, is never quite full-fed, when through some good fortune he finds himself in possession of a few cents, can hardly be expected to lay by for a rainy day. Perhaps, he hasn&apos;t had anything but a little rice and a little fish and a bit of fruit to eat for months. It would be quite unnatural if he did not use his windfall for a feast, and buy, perhaps, a can or a part of a can of California sardines. With the introduction of the plantation system into the thinly- settled undeveloped countries, and with the establishment of peace and order, a rapid increase in population follows. Since the native does not specialize in production but practices subsistence farming, he does not produce a surplus with which to raise his standard of liv&#172; ing. He lives as before, and multiplies as before. If he were able to raise his standard of living materially, there is every reason to believe he would ultimately lessen his rate of increase, for this has happened, or is happening, wherever the standard of living has become fairly high. The time, therefore, soon comes when the native and the plantation between them occupy and till every foot of arable land. The problem the colonial power then has to face is how to feed the growing numbers. It is soon confronted with the need of expropriating the land of the plantations and turning it over to the native. This is agricultural revolution&#8212;in principle no</essay:p>

            <essay:p>different from that which has been forced in many places and many periods by revolts of the peasant, the peon, or the serf. The subdivision of estates is but a temporary solution, for the native uses the additional land for more subsistence farming which is incapable of rapidly raising his standards of living and checking his increase. The result must ultimately be that the colony is devoted almost wholly to the production of food for the native, and the export of raw materials theretofore produced on the plantations ceases. The effects upon the commerce and industries of the home country are obvious. In the long run, therefore, it is to the advan&#172; tage of the home country to teach the native specialization in agri&#172; cultural production in order that he can produce that which can be produced most efficiently. Such products may then be sold on the markets of the world for enough, and more than enough, to supply subsistence for the native. The surplus beyond this he will employ in raising his standard of living, and this means purchase from abroad of manufactured goods. The commerce and industry of the home country will thereby increase and not diminish. Both the colony and the mother country will profit; but to bring about such a happy outcome is possible only through the adoption of a suitable land-utilization policy in the colony. It is obvious, then, that land utilization lies at the bottom of some of the most important colonial problems. Land Utilization and World Peace In&apos; short, land utilization is so interwoven with every other type of national and international policy that land-utilization studies can&#172; not be segregated from studies of other aspects of national policy. Ely recognizes these intimate interrelations when he says, &quot;A land policy takes as a starting point the existing situation with respect to land, land as here used being equivalent to all the natural resources of the country. It examines the processes of evolution by which the existing situation has been reached and proceeds to develop a con&#172; scious program of social control with respect to the acquisition, ownership, conservation, and uses of the land of the country and also with respect to the human relations arising out of use and ownership. ... A land policy must look toward the maintenance of peace in the world, not merely international peace but what is</essay:p>

            <essay:p>even more essential, peace at home. The prosperity of war is tem&#172; porary and illusory. War spells poverty. Our land policies must have relation to world land policies and be of such a nature as to provide the nations of the world with food and raw materials. In our own country [the United States] there must be a proper pro&#172; portion between agricultural production and the production of non- agricultural goods and services. This is fundamental in the establish&#172; ment of a national land policy. . . . The problem to which attention is called as a land-utilization problem is that of proper proportion in the different kinds of economic production. . . .&quot;1T The Case of Japan Professor Nasu takes an equally broad view of the intimate re&#172; lationships between land-utilization and national policy when he de&#172; scribes the methods of his investigation of land-utilization policy in Japan in the following terms: &apos;A . . How is the utilization of land in Japan determined by her natural and social conditions? . . . What changes are possible in those natural and social circumstances? . . . Japan now faces an im&#172; portant problem of population and food supply. The above ques&#172; tions regarding the present conditions of land utilization, and the consequent inquiry as to future conditions are of course related to the problem. A right solution ought to be founded upon a correct understanding of Japan&apos;s national economy in its entirety, so we must start our investigation from an examination of her international accounts. When we examine her foreign commerce together with her domestic production we shall be in a position to know the place she occupies in the world&apos;s economy and shall be confronted with the problem of shortage of food which she now faces. This inquiry comprises the following: What is the primary cause of such shortage? Can Japan supply herself with sufficient food by means of better land utilization? What circumstances prevent the realization of self- supply? &quot;The ultimate basis of our investigations into the essentials of the problem is necessarily found in the natural conditions of the country. 17 R.

            <essay:p>Can Japan be properly described as favored in its climate, topog&#172; raphy, and soil? What is the extent of its underground deposits and water power? Further, it is necessary to consider the various social conditions which affect the development of those natural resources. &quot;By first describing these natural and social conditions, we shall, I think, make the subsequent statement of the conditions of land utilization easily understandable. We shall, therefore, first men&#172; tion the kinds of utilization of land and natural forces, for the pur&#172; pose of giving the reader a general idea of the arable land, forests, mines, rivers, and the like in this country. Then we shall endeavor to explain the particular conditions of land utilization, confining our observations on the arable land to the following points: the system of Japanese agriculture as it varies according to different districts; the exact proportion of arable land actually tilled (rate of exploita&#172; tion) ; intensive cultivation by which several crops are raised succes&#172; sively in one year from the utilization in Japan, its productive power and profitableness and its ability to support the population. &quot;Next to the above, we shall endeavor to deal with important points regarding the utilization of forests, wild lands, and mines. . . . &quot;After dealing with the first part of our inquiry, mentioned above, we shall proceed to consider the future conditions of land utiliza&#172; tion. In order to forecast the food-supplying capacity or power of the land to support the population in the near future, we shall esti&#172; mate the approximate area of land which is fit for cultivation in the near future; the approximate area of land fit for future afforestation; the approximate area of wild land fit for future pasturage; together with the possibility of increase in utilization of these lands for culti&#172; vation, afforestation, and pasturage.

            <essay:p>will be affected to a certain extent by the rice to be imported from the colonies.&quot;19 &quot;All these countries [Borneo, Indochina, Siam] may be regarded as territories likely to produce rice in increasing quantities in the future, to such an extent as to safeguard the food supply for all rice-eating races on earth. So these rice producing countries will constitute very formidable competitors of the Japanese farmers. Al&#172; though the adherence to the home-produced rice by the Japanese is historical, they will find it very easy to give up this habit when they are forced by economic conditions to do so, and will be content with the inferior foreign rice. This theory finds strong support in the present fact that many farmers in this country sell the rice they have produced and buy foreign rice. Even from a theoretical viewpoint, therefore, the importation of foreign rice will affect Japan in a man&#172; ner similar to the importation of rice from Korea or Formosa.&quot;20 &apos;A . . All these unfavorable circumstances being taken into con&#172; sideration, we must come to the conclusion that Japan can scarcely expect to win in the international competition in the cultivation of wheat. In other words, the increase of demand for wheat at home will not be met sufficiently by the increased production at home. We cannot, therefore, expect any marked progress in the utilization of land in Japan by the cultivation of barley, wheat, etc.&quot;21 &quot;. . . There is one fact which attracts our special attention: a gradual decrease in the production of miscellaneous cereals as against a gradual increase in vegetables due to increase in population. As to the former, the decrease is accounted for by the influence of the standard of living, leading the people to prefer better foods than these. As to the latter, there is always a difficulty in the way of imports and the higher standard of living as well as the increase in population to account for the increase in demand. ;&apos;A similar tendency is found in fruits, the demand for which is constantly increasing. This is peculiar evidence of the development of Japanese economic conditions. Superior fruits have been pro&#172; duced in recent years by means of improved methods of cultivation. Some of these fruits have never been produced in Japan before. Ibid., p. 250. Ibid., p. 251. Ibid., p. 253.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The planted area is also steadily increasing. Owing to the recently improved means of transportation, these good fruits are finding a larger market, all over the country. According to the oflicial statis&#172; tics in the past decade, the production of fruits has increased in value from &#165;29,000,000 to &#165;78,000,000, a very remarkable increase indeed. &quot;The increase in vegetables and fruits thus constitutes a peculiar feature of the development of Japanese agriculture. The prospects of further development in this kind of land utilization are definitely bright and sure. The current discussion in this country about the system of marketing is chiefly concerned with such domestic mer&#172; chandise.&quot;22 &quot;Raw silk, unlike rice or any other food product, is a commodity perfectly fit for foreign markets, so that sericulture is entirely dif&#172; ferent from other branches of agriculture, such as the cultivation of cereals, which are mainly meant for domestic consumption. It is very difficult to anticipate future changes in the conditions of seri&#172; culture. The most outstanding feature of Japanese agriculture is certainly the remarkable increase in the planted area of mulberry in recent years. In a district where sericulture is intensively pursued by the farmers, some of them are glad to convert paddy fields into mulberry farms, in bold defiance of the traditional belief in the value of paddy fields. This enthusiastic interest is fast finding its way into villages which have hitherto quietly pursued the conven&#172; tional system of agriculture. Inasmuch as sericulture is under the direct influence of foreign trade, those farmers who are interested in it necessarily expose themselves to special financial risks through every change in the foreign exchange rate or the fluctuations of the raw-silk market in Nev/ York. The future utilization of land for mulberry farms will, therefore, entirely depend on the future market situation of raw silk in the world at large. In the present discus&#172; sion, accordingly, we must first turn our attention to the competitor of Japanese raw silk and substitute goods for raw silk. At present Japan supplies sixty per cent of raw silk offered to the world market, ranking first in the world. . . . &quot;When political unification in China is completed and scientific methods are applied to such industries, the Chinese producers will become formidable rivals of the Japanese on account of the larger 22 Ibid., p. 254.</essay:p>

Should the Nationalist Government&apos;s ideal for peace and unity materialize, this forecast will become a reality menacing Japanese sericulturists. . . . &quot;On the other hand, we have some reason to suppose that in skill in sericulture, particularly in reeling, the Chinese will not excel the Japanese for some time to come. As far as Japanese raw silk remains superior in quality to Chinese, there will be little need to fear Chinese rivalry. &quot;However, in the event of Chinese raw silk improving in quality up to the Japanese standard, the lower cost of production of the former cannot but affect the latter seriously. It is necessary, there&#172; fore, for the Japanese people to formulate a suitable plan to meet such an eventuality before it is too late. Indeed, some Japanese sericulturists have already begun to prepare for possible competition with China, as may be seen in such new devices as feeding silk worms on mulberry branches or outdoor feeding, for which special technical skill is required, although the management does not need so great an amount of labor as in the case of previous methods. &quot;The remarkable development of the rayon industry is another fact that requires our careful attention on account of its future rivalry with raw silk.&quot;23 &quot;. . . If this [sericulture] most important part of agriculture is ruined, and no other profitable substitute is found to take its place in the farmers&apos; activities, we must anticipate very serious difficulties while the population-embracing capacity of agricultural land will be reduced to a considerable extent. . . . &quot;Through special circumstances, however, a diminution of the area of farm land may take place without any lowering of the stand&#172; ard of living. The planting of fruit-trees and vegetables, for in&#172; stance, using scientific methods, would constitute an example of this. . . . &quot;On the other hand, we must know that any future extension of arable land will be the result of the development of less fertile land, and also that there is a tendency to an elevation of the living stand&#172; ard among the farmers due to the trend of the times. Taking all these circumstances into consideration, we come to the general con- Ibid., pp. 255-7.</essay:p>

Everything considered, we can hardly expect to see 40,- 000,000 farming population on the home land of Japan, however the land utilization may develop in the future. On the contrary, we should be grateful for Japanese agriculture if it will succeed in maintaining the present rural population.&quot;25 The Need for Organized Research Admitted, it may be argued, that investigations in land utiliza&#172; tion are of fundamental national and international importance, is it not the duty of governments and other public agencies to undertake them? Why should private institutions, universities, research in&#172; stitutes, associations like the Institute of Pacific Relations devote any of their resources to them? Why should such non-profit-making organizations concern themselves with the problems of the land, when they do not concern themselves with the problems of com&#172; merce and industry? The truth is that they have concerned them&#172; selves with commerce and industry. Professors of economics, for example, have long concerned themselves far more with the problems of commerce, industry, and finance than with the problems of agriculture. However, even if they had not, there would be far greater justification for research in agriculture by private founda&#172; tions and universities (and by governments) than in commerce, in&#172; dustry, or finance. Merchants, manufacturers, and bankers are com&#172; monly strong with respect to capital; the units they control are large; their numbers are relatively small; and they are usually well or&#172; ganized in trade associations of one sort or another. They are well able to do for themselves without the help of private or governmental agencies the sort of research that corresponds to land-utilization in&#172; vestigation. The farmers of a country, on the contrary, taken as a whole, have little free capital at their disposal; the production unit each controls is small; the number of farmers is relatively great; they are highly individualistic; and they are rarely united in effective organizations.

This is the justification for governments and for private organizations sup&#172; porting research in the uses of land. It would be unwise to leave the conduct of such studies wholly in the hands of governments, be&#172; cause governments cannot from their very nature have a scientific at- tude toward any research, whether in the use of land or in anything else, if the results of research have a bearing upon national policies. Governments are ordinarily committed to very definite policies. In undertaking investigations, they tend to search not for truth as such, but for the particular truth&#8212;more often half truth&#8212;that can be used as an argument to support government policy. Private organi&#172; zations are under no pressure to search for any particular truth and to be blind to others. The Uses of Land-Utilization Studies Nations, of course, are rarely, if ever, unanimous in their choice of policies. Usually policies have been, perhaps always will be, the resultant of a number of forces acting in different directions. Where a single interest, usually an economic one, has been overwhelmingly powerful, it has determined the policy. Where no one interest has been stronger than a group of other interests acting more or less in concert, the policy has been a compromise. Indeed, a people, and even its statesmen, are seldom conscious of adopting a policy when they are in the very act of doing so. Policies are usually mosaics adopted piecemeal; and only after they have been long in force does the pattern they make become apparent. It is the dream of students of land utilization that, if the facts concerning the utilization of land are made known and if the consequences of alternative uses of land are made clear, agricultural policies may, in some measure at least, be adopted with clear consciousness of their significance and in the common interest rather than in that of a class or geographic group. But more than this is necessary: the ultimate end needs to be kept clearly before the mind&apos;s eye. Often the end formulates itself in the minds of statesmen no more concretely than that they want their country to be powerful and prosperous. It remains to be seen whether in these days of much loose talk&#8212;and writing&#8212;about na&#172; tional and even international planning statesmen will stop to think what sort of a world they propose to plan for. Obviously one cannot</essay:p>

            <essay:p>draw the plans for a ship unless one knows whether it is to be a surface vessel or a submarine. One cannot plan for a nation or a world unless one knows what sort of nation or world one wants. And this raises the question: what is the end to which an agricul&#172; tural policy is directed? The answer obviously is, toward the attain&#172; ment of the greatest possible general welfare. But who is to deter&#172; mine the direction in which welfare is to be sought&#8212;the farmer or the factory worker, the capitalist or the proletarian, the artist or the scientist, the clergyman or the philosopher? We have here to deal with spiritual values not susceptible to scientific assay. A people may chose to work toward a given end for spiritual reasons, even though it is demonstrable that this end cannot possibly yield the maximum of material welfare. For example, there are those who, while admitting that a benevolent, all-wise dictatorship is likely to yield the maximum of material welfare, nevertheless prefer the per&#172; sonal liberty possible in some forms of democracy, even though this entails a lower standard of living. These are the people who prefer laissez-faire to a planned economy. Thus, a nation may deliberately elect to have a large proportion of its population live on farms, be&#172; cause it believes, rightly or wrongly, that rural life is; better than urban life. To bring this about, it may subsidize farming in one way or another. It will, then, produce agricultural materials at higher cost than it would have to pay to purchase from abroad. The re&#172; sult may well be a lower per capita real income and, therefore, a lower standard of living than might otherwise be attained. And yet, the nation may prefer a lower standard of living and rural life to a higher standard of living and urbanization. Or a nation may prefer the country to be densely populated with a low standard of living than to have it thinly populated with a high standard of living. It is not the business of the economist or the political scientist or the sociologist to say which of a pair of alternatives of this sort a country should choose, for into the making of such a choice many factors besides reason enter. However, it is their business to point out the probable consequences of alternative choices, and, once the choice has been made, to point out the various methods by which the chosen end can be achieved, and to compare the relative merits of these methods. Whoever may make the decision and whatever sort of world he</essay:p>

The subject of the memo&#172; randum bears so directly on the program of discus&#172; sions planned for that conference that the Secretariat has no hesitation in strongly recommending it for study by all conference members. While the Secre&#172; tariat has undertaken the publication of the memo&#172; randum, the Institute itself assumes no responsibility for statements of fact or opinion contained in it.

            <essay:p>Some Social Aspects of World Economic Planning ECONOMIC planning is far from being a new conception. It is at least as old as socialism; and many of the Utopias and ideal republics of earlier times contain the germ of the idea. But while dating back some centuries, perhaps, economic planning in its present form is essentially an outcome of modern technology and the forms of organisation of production, of marketing, of the medium of exchange, and of the division of the product of industry that this technology has developed. In the last few years it has attracted special attention, due mainly to the concurrent existence of an abnormally severe depression in the whole of the capitalist world and a spectacular experiment in the central organisation of economic activity in Soviet Russia. Within the last few months significant steps in the direction of economic planning have been taken in a number of countries, notably the United States. At present the term is commonly applied and misapplied to the most varied proposals&#8212;anything, in fact, from the total abolition of the price system, and all that goes with it, to the haphazard inter&#172; ferences with the principle of laissez-faire which are at present taking place in most countries. Furthermore, lending itself as it does to exaggerated statement, economic planning tends at the moment to fall into disrepute among the more sophisticated. For these reasons it would seem that a discussion of its international and social impli&#172; cations, to be of any value, must necessarily be preceded by a brief review of certain of the factors in present-day economic life which would appear to make economic planning necessary; and some ex&#172; amination of the problems which such planning would be called upon to solve. THE FACTORS WHICH MAKE ECONOMIC PLANNING NECESSARY The factors which make economic planning necessary may be roughly divided into two classes:&#8212;those predominantly psychologi-</essay:p>

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS First among the psychological factors, at least so far as present public opinion is concerned, must be placed the striking contrast between experience in the capitalist countries and experience in Soviet Russia during recent years. The indexes of production in the various countries over the period of the last decade shew this con&#172; trast in high relief.1 It may be said with some assurance that if this difference in movement persists for any considerable length of time &#8212;that is to say if the present depression continues more or less unabated, and the Russian experiment does not completely break down&#8212;the tendency towards some form of economic planning in the capitalist countries is likely to become marked. Closely related to this illuminating comparison are two or three considerations relating to economic organisation in the capitalist countries, sufficiently broad and self-evident to exercise a powerful influence upon public opinion. There is unquestionably a wide&#172; spread feeling that a system in which production to meet the needs of the world is in the nature of a by-product of the pursuit of indi&#172; vidual gain is unlikely to prove permanently satisfactory. Certain of the consequences of this system have particularly impressed the public mind. That it should be possible to have supplies of raw material, factory facilities to convert these materials into finished goods, man-power to produce these materials and to operate these machines, and a wealth of idle capital looking for investment, all present in manifest excess, while on every hand men and women are destitute, producers are going bankrupt and Governments are unable to pay their way, is a fact which has done more than anything else, perhaps, to persuade the present generation that human ingenuity should be able to devise a better economic system than that at present obtaining. 1 See League of Nations: Supplement to the Monthly Bulletin of Statistics No 5 May, 1933, Diagram VI. &apos;</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Second only to this is the evident absurdity of the economic rela&#172; tionships between nations. The refusal of creditor nations to receive the payment of their debts in goods; the tariff barriers and subsidies by which nations endeavour to ensure that, as far as possible, their own people shall pay heavily for goods, while the peoples of other nations shall be able to buy the same goods at the cheapest possible rates; the wholesale destruction of wheat, coffee and other foodstuffs and materials, when these foodstuffs and materials are grievously needed in other countries, and in many cases even in the country where the destruction is going on: these, and similar aspects of present-day economic life under the influence of depression have necessarily influenced the public mind in the direction of planning. Along with these two phenomena, peculiar in the main to a period of acute depression, the more permanent feature of economic in&#172; equality, as it occurs in the modern industrial state, and the gradual awakening of a social conscience are factors of evident potency in reinforcing the view that the present system is not one of lasting validity but merely a transitional stage. More fundamental than any of these factors, inasmuch as it is more general, more insidious and more lasting in its effect, is the influence of modern industrial technique upon habits of thought. Men and women accustomed to the planned and organised methods of factory production are prone to extend these methods into wider and wider areas, until they embrace all, or nearly all, of the various aspects of the making and marketing of goods. In a world of small producers, of agriculture and handicrafts, laissez-faire was more or less appropriate, both as a method and as a way of thought. In a world dominated by machine technique, and the organisation which such technique necessarily involves, economic planning tends to become inevitable. THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL FACTORS The economic and financial factors making for the development of planning are of even greater significance in the present context, inasmuch as they indicate to some extent the direction in which planning is likely to be guided by the logic of events. Three at least of these factors require to be examined if the necessity for some</essay:p>

            <essay:p>measure of economic planning is to be correctly evaluated. These are the breakdown of the international monetary system, the break&#172; down of the system of international trade, and the breakdown of the mechanism of adjustment of prices and costs. The breakdown of the international monetary system. For well over a century the gold standard has been the monetary system par excellence. At a time when the developing world community re&#172; quired above all else a single monetary standard, and a relatively stable one, it supplied that need. With its aid an expansion of world commerce unparalleled in history was rendered possible. Its tem&#172; porary abandonment during the war period, far from lowering its prestige, served but to stimulate a universal determination to restore it with the shortest possible delay. By 1925 the return movement had begun in earnest; by 1928 it was virtually achieved. The world was a gold-standard world more completely than ever before. Three years later the system so laboriously restored was in ruins. At the time of writing, four countries only can be considered as applying the gold standard&#8212;France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzer&#172; land. The remaining countries have either definitely abandoned it or have imposed such regulations upon the free movement of money across their respective frontiers that the system is in more or less complete abeyance. The reasons for this breakdown are many and confused; but the fundamental factors responsible are now fairly clear. The pre-war gold standard, though international in scope, was based on no specific international agreement. It was able to survive, and to function successfully over an extended period, chiefly because the policy which suited Great Britain&#8212;the outstanding industrial, financial, trading and creditor nation of the time&#8212;was conducive to the maintenance of gold as a world currency. Throughout the ten or twenty years preceding the World War, Great Britain at any moment, by calling in her foreign investments, could, in theory, have drawn into her coffers the great mass of the world&apos;s stock of monetary gold. In point of fact, she followed precisely the opposite policy. While selling abroad in large volume, she permitted the free entry of goods in exchange. Furthermore, British investors were always ready to</essay:p>

Under these circumstances, the &quot;automatic&quot; gold standard was in fact not so much an international system as a British system applied internationally; and, as such, it worked. Since the World War the United States and France have shared with Great Britain the privilege and burden of the international application of the gold standard; but both in their tariffs and in their investment policies these two countries follow radically different lines from those followed in pre-war Britain. They do not permit the free entry of goods, and they do not consistently invest abroad on long term to the full extent of their resources. Consequently, their position as creditor countries, notably on reparation and war debt accounts, has led to a flow of gold into their reserves at the expense of the reserves of other countries. Roughly speaking, each of these countries now holds about a third of the world&apos;s monetary gold, leaving the other fifty or more countries just over a third on which to do their business. A second and closely related factor tending to make the &quot;auto&#172; matic&quot; gold standard unworkable in the post-war world is that it is no longer permitted to have its &quot;automatic&quot; effect. According to the classical theory of the gold standard, a country which is living beyond its means&#8212;typically, importing more than it is exporting2&#8212; will sooner or later have to make good the difference by paying away gold. This will bring about a monetary stringency in the country in question, which, by forcing down money incomes, prices and costs, will discourage its import trade and encourage its exports. Conversely, the countries receiving the gold will expand their monetary circulation; and the consequent increase in money incomes, prices and costs will tend to encourage their imports and discourage their exports&#8212;this process continuing until imports and exports find a new equilibrium. There is some doubt whether this system has ever worked strictly according to theory, but there is no doubt that of recent years posi&#172; tive steps have been taken in various countries to prevent it from 2 Including invisible items as well as merchandise.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>working. An efflux or an influx of gold is not permitted to have its full effect upon the monetary system of the country concerned. Furthermore, the monetary system itself no longer dominates the price and cost position. In this way, contrary to the whole theory of the &quot;automatic&quot; gold standard, one country may lose gold without any marked effect upon its economy, while another may accumulate gold rapidly and merely hoard it away. Under such conditions it is only a matter of time and circumstances for the system to collapse. There is, moreover, a powerful factor, come into full operation only during the past few years, making such collapse far more likely and far more sudden than it would otherwise be. Under modern conditions the transfer of capital from one country to another can be easily and rapidly effected, so that a mere rumour may result in progressive sales of securities and withdrawals of short-term bal&#172; ances, leading in turn to a large-scale expatriation of capital, against which the most massive gold reserve in the world is powerless. It should perhaps be emphasised that in thus drawing attention to the phenomena fundamentally responsible for the breakdown of the &quot;automatic&quot; gold standard, there is no intention either of condemn&#172; ing or of approving the policies followed by certain of the leading countries in this whole question; indeed, attempts to apportion responsibility are for the most part beside the point. The essential fact that requires to be brought out is that, quite apart from whether these various policies were right or wrong in themselves, they were not compatible with the &quot;automatic&quot; gold standard. If this standard is to work creditor countries must use gold, not hoard it; gold movements must be permitted to have their full effect upon the monetary mechanism; and prices and costs must be made to respond. Whether under these conditions the &quot;automatic&quot; gold standard is worth the working is, of course, another question. But to endeavour to work it with one hand and to prevent it from working with the other is obviously a policy doomed to failure. Particularly is it not practicable when, as in recent years, there are a number of special features&#8212;trade restrictions, reparation pay&#172; ments and war debts being among the most important&#8212;putting an additional strain upon the mechanism. Without these special features the restored gold standard might have lasted more than the three</essay:p>

            <essay:p>years it actually endured. But while this is true, it cannot be too strongly emphasised that the defects in this system, as it is now applied, are not accidental and temporary but&#8212;unless the countries most concerned are ready to make drastic changes in their financial economic and social policies&#8212;fundamental and permanent. The re-organisation of an international monetary standard is thus likely to be one of the first measures in the direction of large-scale economic planning that facts will tend to force upon the world. The breakdown of the system of international trade. Along with this breakdown of the international monetary standard there is the partial breakdown of international trade. World trade at the present time has declined to approximately one-third of its money value in 1929.3 This decline is explained, to some extent, by the fall in prices during recent years; but not by any means entirely. There has been a massive diminution not merely in the value but also in the physical volume of international trade.4 In evaluating this movement, more&#172; over, it is necessary to bear in mind that already in 1929 world trade was impeded by a multitude of barriers of all sorts, so that the pres&#172; ent decline is in effect a decline from what, under freer conditions, would appear as a decidedly low level. The falling off in international trade is undoubtedly due, in large part, to the artificial obstacles put in its way: exchange restrictions, prohibitive tariffs, quotas, licences, prohibitions and other like mea&#172; sures. To a certain extent this interference with international trade is the outcome of attempts, not always well conceived, to inaugurate some measure of national economic planning. But for the most part the actuating motives are more questionable. Chief among them, in all probability, is the influence of extreme nationalism. Here, obvi&#172; ously, a remedy must be sought in the political rather than the eco&#172; nomic sphere. Apart from this, the present monetary difficulties, dealt with in the preceding section, are responsible in large part for much of the immediate trouble, particularly the restrictions upon exchanges. Among other major factors in the situation, certain illegitimate forms of international competition have been especially 3 Cf. op. cit., Diagram III. 4 Cf. op. cit., Table II and Diagram.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>noticeable during recent years as leading to inhibitions upon interna&#172; tional trade. They may conveniently be referred to as &quot;economic dumping&quot;, &quot;exchange dumping&quot; and &quot;social dumping&quot; respectively. By economic dumping is meant the granting of subsidies, direct or indirect, so as to promote exports. Exchange dumping is the pro&#172; motion of exports by an unduly depreciated foreign exchange rate. Social dumping is the name sometimes given to the unfair competi&#172; tion promoted by abnormally low wages, long hours, or otherwise unsatisfactory conditions of labour. The setting up of factories on a large scale in countries where labour is plentiful and cheap has made this social dumping of special importance during the last few years. Finally, the fact that except at rare intervals the market for goods in general is inadequate, and particularly so in times of depression, necessarily inclines countries to take measures to protect their home market in the attempt to retain at least that outlet for their products. The breakdown of the mechanism of adjustment of prices and costs. Less obvious upon the surface, but fundamentally the most important of all the economic and financial factors making for economic planning, is the breakdown of the mechanism of adjust&#172; ment of prices and costs. The monetary and economic system which grew up in the nine&#172; teenth century, and which, in a modified form, still prevails, permits of large variations in the total volume of effective demand for the product of industry. At times the volume of demand is not merely sufficient but more than sufficient to enable the total volume of goods being offered for sale to be disposed of at remunerative prices. At other times the volume of effective demand&#8212;the amount of pur&#172; chasing power actually being used to buy goods&#8212;is definitely not sufficient to enable these goods to be sold otherwise than at a loss. When such a deficiency of active purchasing power makes itself felt, industry tends to slow down, since it is no longer profitable to pro&#172; duce. In the past, such a situation was met by an adjustment of prices and costs, and this process of adjustment, sooner or later, permitted production to be resumed. Under present-day conditions, the fluctuations in the volume of effective demand continue to occur &#8212;on a wider scale than ever&#8212;but the price and cost mechanism no longer works effectively.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Fluctuations in effective demand. The fundamental reasons for the larger fluctuations in the volume of effective demand are two in number. In the first place, the modern credit system is much more elastic than the monetary system preceding it, and elastic not only in expansion but in contraction also. This means to say that in times of deep depression the total quantity of currency and credit in circu&#172; lation may be much more considerably reduced than was the case under nineteenth century conditions.5 On top of this, and even more important, the capacity to hold purchasing power idle (i.e., to reduce the velocity of circulation of money) is very great.6 The &quot;free mar&#172; gin&quot; in the hands of individuals and of organisations&#8212;the purchas&#172; ing power which need not be expended but can if necessary be held on one side&#8212;probably constitutes a far larger percentage of the total income than in the past. Moreover, with present-day facilities for inter-communication, it is probable that the influence of mass opti&#172; mism and mass pessimism is more drastically effective than ever before in causing purchasing power to be used more rapidly or less rapidly as the case may be. As a consequence of these two factors of reduced quantity and reduced velocity, the sum total of active pur&#172; chasing power&#8212;of money actually being used to buy goods per unit of time&#8212;is susceptible of large reductions, with correspondingly violent pressure upon the price-and-cost mechanism. Reductions in prices. This mechanism still retains a certain amount of resiliency&#8212;more so in some countries than in others&#8212;but, taking the world as a whole, it can no longer be looked upon as a universal shock absorber unfailingly adjusting the economic system to the uncontrolled vagaries of effective demand. When the volume of purchasing power being used to buy goods fails to keep pace with the volume of goods in general being offered for sale, prices tend to decline&#8212;but not with the precision and regularity that the occasion demands. Where the nature of the product permits, and where the financial resources of the corporations concerned are adequate, goods are held off the market&#8212;thereby (a) preventing the prompt price 5 Cf e g United States Federal Reserve System: Total volume of loans by member banks, 1929: $22,517 million; 1932: $15,267 million&#8212;a reduction of approximately one-third in a period of three years only. 6 Cf. op. cit., Diagram XXV.</essay:p>

On this account, therefore, the price decline resulting from a general deficiency of purchasing power tends to be &quot;patchy&apos;A Other influences present in modern industry tend to make it still more so. Where there is a monopoly or quasi-monopoly of some particular product, those in control may choose to restrict output rather than reduce prices.7 Even where monopoly conditions do not obtain, the process is still of importance so far as certain large groups of commodities are concerned. In particular, whereas a manufacturer working on a profit-and-loss basis will tend to restrict production to the point where his losses are a minimum, the independent farmer will often attempt to make up for lower prices by increasing produc&#172; tion. There is thus liable to be a wide difference in the movements of prices of manufactured goods and of agricultural goods respec&#172; tively; although here again the presence or absence of monopoly conditions and the possibility or otherwise of holding stocks may at times introduce modifications in the general process. So much for the unequal development of the price movement so far as the supply side is concerned. On the demand side, the falling off in the total volume of buying likewise tends to bring about a number of price disequilibria. Certain types of goods, basically necessary to life, continue to find buyers in approximately the same volume as before. Other types&#8212;durable goods and, above all, equipment for making goods&#8212;find the springs of demand almost completely dried up. As a consequence, there is yet another factor making for unevenness in the rate of decline of commodity prices. Thus, the price reductions consequent upon inadequate effective demand, while in one respect a first step towards possible re-adjust&#172; ment, under conditions of modern industry are liable to be at the same time a pregnant source of future difficulties, inasmuch as special circumstances make the rate of decline in the prices of the various 7 Cf. op. cit., Diagram XXII.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>products exceedingly unequal. The cost reductions which should accompany these price reductions, if the mechanism is to work according to theory, are even more uncertain and liable to lead to disequilibria of various sorts. Reductions in costs. Taking industry as a whole, there are three main ways of reducing costs: introducing labour-saving devices; reducing overhead expenses; and reducing wage rates. Labour-saving devices introduced in time of depression, while advantageous to the individual undertaking, are by no means un&#172; mixed advantages to industry and the community as a whole. A firm which, finding itself unable to cover expenses, introduces a labour-saving device or speeds up work so that the same output is achieved with less men than before, reduces its labour cost and in this way manages to continue in operation when otherwise it might have to close down. This is all to the good; but the men thrust out of work are not likely to find employment again, so long as the depression lasts. It is true that the firm in question will need less working capital than before, and theoretically this should be avail&#172; able to provide employment. But in practice the firm will ordinarily use it to reduce its indebtedness to the bank, and during depression the credit thus extinguished is not likely to be renewed elsewhere. Again, the reduction in costs may enable it to increase sales, so that after all it can keep the whole of its labour force employed; but such an increase in sales is likely to be at the expense of some other firms, since in time of depression it is very rare that an increase in the total consumption of any product takes place; which means in effect that the technological unemployment due to the labour-saving device has merely been transferred to the firms whose sales have been reduced. Such a situation has two major consequences, tending to intensify and prolong depression. For one thing, the unemployment benefit, unemployment relief, or whatever other aid may be given to the men thrown out of work, normally carries with it an increase in taxation. For another, the fact that these unemployed men and their families will necessarily be restricting their purchase to a minimum tends to keep effective demand inadequate. In this manner the</essay:p>

            <essay:p>application of labour-saving devices in time of depression, while helping to revive business from the standpoint of the industrial firm making the change, is liable to give rise to further depressive influ&#172; ences, making for, rather than reducing, the prevailing stagnation. This, of course, is in no way to contradict the self-evident proposi&#172; tion that in the long run labour-saving devices tend to improve the general standard of living. The point here is that they do not necessarily tend to bring about industrial revival but, to a certain extent, have the reverse effect. So much for the reduction of costs by improved methods. In many firms and industries, means of saving labour to the extent necessary to offset the decline in price are either not available or are financially out of the question in time of depression. Particularly is this the case when the price decline is of the present magnitude. Under such circumstances, if production is to be made remunerative at the abnormally depressed price level obtaining, recourse must be had to reduction in overhead expenses, or reduction in wage rates, or both. Under present-day conditions, reduction in overhead expenses is exceedingly difficult to bring about. It is these costs, above all, that fail to meet the requirements of the cost-and-price mechanism of adjustment. As the statistics of the United States Census of Manu&#172; factures shew, it is overhead charges rather than labour costs that tend to make production unremunerative. The following table8 is eloquent in this respect. Average Average Selling Cost of Labour Materials Average Over&#172; head Costs plus Profits 100 108 95 The reasons why overhead expenses are thus recalcitrant are well known. In the first place, such costs represent for the most part long-term commitments and contracts&#8212;rent, insurance and so forth. In the second place, the huge increase in manufacturing plant&#8212; which incidentally tends to be financed more and more by fixed- 8 National Bureau of Economic Research: Bulletin No. 45, February 20th, 1933.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>interest-bearing securities rather than by equities&#8212;results in a large increase in the overhead element. (Thus, in the United States, while the overhead plus profit element in total costs per unit of product amounted to 18 per cent in 1919, it was as high as 25 per cent in 1929). In the third place, when the production of a factory is restricted during depression, the overhead expenditure continues in great part unchanged&#8212;so that, with the diminished output, each unit of product has to support a larger fraction of the total over&#172; head cost. On the whole, therefore, reduction in overhead charges to corre&#172; spond with the fall in prices is exceedingly difficult. The possibility of reducing wage rates to meet the situation would appear to be equally out of the question, both in theory and in practice. Leaving the ethical and social considerations involved completely on one side and examining the question from the point of view of what is feasible, in the narrowest sense of the term, three major considera&#172; tions require to be taken into account. In the first place, in a depression as profound as that in process, wage rates in practice cannot be cut to the extent necessary to reduce costs to the level required. Trade unions, unemployment insurance, charitable relief, public opinion and the philosophy of the employers themselves are among the main factors making such a course impossible. In the second place, supposing wage rates were reduced to the extent required, there is good reason to believe that in a depression of the present magnitude the immediate effect would take the form of such a drastic reduction in active purchasing power as to make matters worse rather than better. In the third place, if wage rates were made to bear the brunt of the depression it is greatly to be doubted whether the mass production industries, which rely in great part on working class buying for their prosperity, could be successfully revived. In sum, therefore, the reduction of costs to meet the reduction of prices is a hazardous and uncertain business. As seen above, labour- saving devices, if and when they can be applied in times of depres&#172; sion, while helping individual undertakings, give rise at the same time to difficulties for the community and industry as a whole. Over&#172; head costs are recalcitrant in the extreme and of growing importance.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Wage rates in practice cannot be rapidly reduced, and if they were would be likely in circumstances such as obtain at present to aggra&#172; vate rather than alleviate the depression. Altogether, the price-and-cost adjustment mechanism, whatever it may have been in the past, can now no longer be regarded as a trustworthy instrument calculated to sustain a reasonably high level of business activity under unstable conditions of total effective de&#172; mand. Modern monetary and financial organisation make the pos&#172; sible fluctuations in effective demand much greater than they were in earlier times. The fall in prices resulting from inadequate effective demand are &quot;patchy&quot; and productive of disequilibria of all sorts. Finally, if such a fall in prices is allowed to go uncorrected the reduction in costs necessary to make output remunerative in many cases cannot be effected and if it could be effected would be pregnant with danger to the whole economic system. It has appeared necessary to consider certain of the factors making for economic planning in some detail because otherwise it is impos&#172; sible to estimate the strength of the forces tending to make economic planning a natural outcome of the present world situation, and equally impossible to foresee what general direction the various forms of planning are likely to take. In the ensuing review of some of the main problems which economic planning may be expected to encounter, attention is concentrated more particularly upon those features which the foregoing analysis would seem to indicate as being of especial importance.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>THE PROBLEMS OF ECONOMIC PLANNING THE problems that economic planning is likely to encounter may be conveniently considered under four main heads: the organisa&#172; tion of production; the organisation of trade; the organisation of the medium of exchange; and the organisation of the division of the product of industry. the organisation of production In some respects the organisation of production is less in need of planning than the organisation of trade, of the medium of exchange, and of the division of the product of industry. The outstanding economic difficulty at present is not to increase production, but to enable the goods produced to find a market. On the other hand, while not the most immediate task at the moment, the effective organisation of production is fundamental to the maintenance and improvement of the standard of living, and is unquestionably sus&#172; ceptible of vast amelioration. Such amelioration would have to proceed along a number of lines, including particularly the conserva&#172; tion and economic use of natural resources; a certain amount of control of investment, thereby determining the manner in which the community is to be equipped; the standardisation of products wherever and to whatever extent such standardisation is possible and desirable; broader bases of exploitation, and the concentration of production in the more efficient enterprises; and a system of remuner&#172; ation, and of employment generally, securing the maximum co-oper&#172; ation from those engaged in production. This last point concerning remuneration may be most conveniently considered in connection with the organisation of the division of the product of industry. Of the remaining measures the most immediate would appear to be (1) the provision of investment control, (2) organisation on the basis not so much of the individual enterprise as of the whole of a given industry, and (3) freer trade between the various countries. The degree to which such control and such organisation may be carried, while highly important, is a matter</essay:p>

            <essay:p>irrelevant to the present discussion. The main point, which is hardly likely to be disputed, is that so long as a large proportion of the savings of the community are liable to be wastefully directed&#8212;waste&#172; ful from an economic point of view in many cases, and still more often from a social point of view&#8212;production cannot be looked upon as planned; so long as the making of goods and the rendering of services is more or less a by-product of an internecine war between individual producers in which the inefficient, in the slow process of elimination, are able to undercut the efficient and make production unremunerative; there can be no effective organisation of produc&#172; tion; and so long as the uneconomic conditions that the progressive erection of trade barriers is at present making inevitable are allowed to persist, the general level of productive efficiency, taking the world as a whole, is unnecessarily low. THE ORGANISATION OF TRADE The organisation of production is intimately bound up with the organisation of trade. In an economy where the consumer is given a wide freedom of choice as to the manner in which he will expend his income, it is evident that production must be directed by market&#172; ing, and not vice versa. The all too common practice of making goods and vaguely expecting to be able to dispose of them at a remunerative price is economically wasteful, and in a planned econ&#172; omy must as far as possible be eliminated. This is to say that by some means the rate at which the many thousands of types of goods are being produced must be adapted to the probable demand for those types of goods. This calls for far better, fuller and more timely information on production, stocks and sales, than is at present available. It involves the control of the rate at which the capital equipment for making any particular product is being increased, a point already referred to in the preceding section. Above all, it necessitates the control of the rate at which any particular product is being turned out. Concretely, what this would appear to involve is central marketing agencies, keying in with the organisation of production on an industrial basis. Together with this, some organisa&#172; tion of international producers&apos; agreements would appear essential if world production of certain basic commodities is to be equated</essay:p>

            <essay:p>approximately to world demand. Finally, for marketing agencies to function at all efficiently, much more stable conditions of inter&#172; national trade are absolutely essential. Such changes of tariff, quota and exchange restrictions as have taken place in recent years upset the whole process of scientific marketing, and result in industries equipped to meet a world demand being reduced to working far below their possible capacity, with the consequent great waste of capital equipment, and even more of skill and labour power. THE ORGANISATION OF THE MONETARY MEDIUM The organisation of the monetary medium calls for three main lines of action. The first of these concerns&#8212; The maintenance of active purchasing power. As already seen in the analysis of the factors rendering some measure of economic planning necessary, the volume of effective demand for goods in general is sometimes excessive and sometimes deficient. With the cost-and-price mechanism incapable of making adequate adjustment, permanent means must be available for sustaining effective demand and, on occasion, of preventing effective demand outrunning indus&#172; try&apos;s capacity to produce. More explicitly, there must be the necessary organisation for reinforcing the volume of buying of goods in gen&#172; eral (producers&apos; goods as well as consumers&apos; goods) whenever effec&#172; tive demand tends to become deficient; and on the other hand, of restricting the volume of buying when such restriction is required. It is important to note that measures of this type are in no sense &quot;artificial&quot;, as is sometimes alleged by apologists for the system current in the nineteenth century. The fact is that the system then in operation was radically defective, inasmuch as the total volume of demand was subject to wide and, on occasions, catastrophic fluctua&#172; tions. This defect was to some extent hidden by the flexibility of prices and costs. With this flexibility a thing of the past, the defect shews up in its true light, particularly in the event of effective de&#172; mand falling short of the volume required to keep industry active. In view of its central importance, particularly at the present time, the general lines which measures for maintaining active purchasing power might follow may usefully be outlined:</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The means most readily available, under existing circumstances, for directly reinforcing the volume of effective demand is to use money otherwise lying idle (or if necessary to create new money) for the purpose of financing public works. In this way the idle or new money is put into the hands of public works contractors who use it, for the most part, either to buy producers&apos; goods or else to pay the men they employ, who, in turn, use it in the main to buy consumers&apos; goods. By this means a direct increase in effective demand, both for producers&apos; and for consumers&apos; goods, is brought about. Such reinforcement of active purchasing power, moreover, is a net reinforcement, inasmuch as the public works themselves&#8212; arterial roads, waterways, public buildings, etc.&#8212;are not, for the most part, put upon the market for sale. Without some such net increase in effective demand it would appear impossible in time of depression, or of threatened depression, for the mounting stocks of commodities to be liquidated and for the unused equipment of pro&#172; duction to be brought back into operation. In the event of active purchasing power becoming excessive, the restriction of effective demand can be most readily secured by action on the part of the Central Banks, in raising the discount rate and withdrawing purchasing power from circulation by means of open market sales of securities&#8212;supplemented, if necessary, by Govern&#172; ment action tending to reduce the volume of active purchasing power. These particular methods, it should be said, are given as examples of the type of action required rather than as concrete proposals. As with the other measures involved in economic plan&#172; ning, experiment rather than dogma is necessarily the only appropri&#172; ate basis for effective action. As will be noted, this aspect of the organisation of the monetary medium is a necessary counterpart of the organisation of trade dealt with above. The chief measure, so far as the organisation of trade is concerned, is to adjust the supply of each particular product to the demand for that particular product. With the organisation of the monetary medium, the main object is to adjust demand for goods in general to the possibilities of the supply of goods in general. These two lines of action are complementary and mutually necessary, the one to the other. If the production of each particular type of com-</essay:p>

            <essay:p>modify is adjusted to the demand but no provision is made to keep the volume of buying of goods in general adequate, then production will necessarily be cut down to the deficient demand, and in being so cut down will tend to make demand still more deficient, involving a further restriction of output and so on, in the vicious downward spiral of declining production and declining demand, leading to industrial stagnation and decay. If, on the other hand, effective demand for goods in general is kept adequate, but the various types of goods are not being produced in their right relative proportions, the price system is liable to become badly disorganised, and the efficiency of production, the employment of labour, and the standard of living all suffer as a consequence. The adjustment of production to consumption, and the adjustment of consumption to production, the first applying to each particular commodity, the second to com&#172; modities in general, are the two essential processes fundamental to a planned economy. Stabilisation of the price level. The second aspect of the organisa&#172; tion of the monetary medium concerns the value of money in terms of commodities. It is obviously undesirable that the value of money should fluctuate as widely and erratically as it has done throughout the industrial era. Such fluctuations tend to disorganise the whole economic and social system. A rapidly rising price level destroys the value of savings and discourages thrift, automatically reduces real wages, and leads to great social and industrial unrest. A rapidly falling price level increases the burden of debt, handicaps all enter&#172; prise, and forces countries and business undertakings into suspension of payment, bankruptcy and default. On the other hand, while wide and erratic fluctuations of com&#172; modity price levels are admittedly undesirable, it is not generally agreed what direction control of the value of money should take. There are advocates of a steadily rising price level, the main argu&#172; ment in favour of such a course being that this would tend to restore business prosperity and, by gradually reducing the value of money, would progressively lighten the weight of the &quot;dead hand&quot; of indebtedness upon industry. There are advocates of a price level falling as productivity (output per man-hour) increases, the main reason for holding such a view being that otherwise the reduction in</essay:p>

            <essay:p>costs and consequent increase in profits would result in profit infla&#172; tion and undue development of industry. The third course is for the price level (by which is usually understood the commodity price level at wholesale) to be held approximately stable. The points in favour of such a proposal are that an approximately stable price level represents the closest approach to justice in monetary matters, neither defrauding creditors (as would be the case with a rising price level), nor giving them an unearned increment (as would be the case if money progressively increased in value) ; that an approximately stable price level is the most likely to result in stable business condi&#172; tions, conducing neither to the excessive activity liable to accompany a rising price level, nor to the depressive effect of a falling price level; that the possibility of profit inflation arising from increasing productivity could be met by an appropriate wage system, ensuring that wages rose as productivity increased; and that, from the point of view of international co-ordination, approximately stable price levels in the various countries are to be preferred to price levels moving upwards or downwards. This, incidentally, does not neces&#172; sarily imply that approximate price stabilisation should be at the present level. The question of the value of money would necessarily have to be integrated with the question examined above, of sustain&#172; ing effective demand. In particular, at a time such as the present, it would be necessary first of all to reinforce active purchasing power to the extent required to bring about a resumption of business activity, and only when that was accomplished to aim at approximate price stability henceforward. Exchange stability and an international monetary standard. The third aspect of organisation of the monetary medium concerns the setting up of an international monetary standard. If, as would seem probable, the &quot;semi-automatic&quot; gold standard is no longer adequate to the needs of the industrial and commercial world, some alternative system requires to be devised, ensuring the ready transfer of purchas&#172; ing power from one country to another, at approximately stable rates of exchange. Along what lines this new system is likely to be framed it is difficult to say, but certain of its main features may perhaps be foreseen. In the first place, it may be taken as fairly certain that gold will be retained as an international monetary medium. As the</essay:p>

On the other hand, it is never again likely to exercise the predominant influence upon monetary policy that it had in the nineteenth century. The essential basis for exchange stability in the future would appear to be an international agreement among the more important industrial, commercial and financial countries to follow the same general price policy&#8212;in all probability that of approximate stabilisation of their respective commodity price levels at wholesale. Such exchange stability as might be obtained by these means would be likely to range between considerably wider limits than the &quot;gold points&quot; of the semi-automatic standard, and might at times call for re-adjustment in respect of some particular country whose position on the world market had definitely changed. But while thus open to criticism at certain points, no other practical means of securing approximate exchange stability, permitting at the same time of the maintenance of active purchasing power and the control of fluctuations in the price levels of the various countries, would appear available. Lastly, among the countries entering into an agreement to hold their respective price levels approximately stable, some arrangement would be necessary by which each signatory State was guaranteed against a &quot;flight&quot; from its currency, so long as it proceeded in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Failing some such measure as this, the success of any form of international monetary standard would appear doubtful. ***** These three aspects of the organisation of the medium of ex&#172; change, relating to the maintenance of active purchasing power, the control of the value of money, and the setting up of an effective international monetary standard respectively, have been examined in rather more detail than the other main divisions of economic plan&#172; ning, not because they are inherently more important, but because they happen to be more important under the conditions of the present era. The organisation of production, while falling far short of what it might be, is nevertheless relatively efficient in the sense that far more can be made than can be disposed of under existing conditions. The organisation of marketing is at a more primitive stage than the</essay:p>

            <essay:p>organisation of production, and consequently demands more atten&#172; tion; but the loss occasioned by disproportionate production of particular commodities is relatively small alongside the economic waste arising from the intermittent general deficiency of active pur&#172; chasing power, the fluctuations in the commodity price level and the failure of the international monetary mechanism consequent upon the breakdown of the gold standard. It is the organisation of the medium of exchange&#8212;in particular the maintenance of active pur&#172; chasing power&#8212;that would appear to be at the centre of economic planning at the present time. THE ORGANISATION OF THE DIVISION OF THE PRODUCT OF INDUSTRY The organisation of the division of the product of industry, with wage questions as its most important element, cuts across the three fields of economic planning already examined. In the first place, it materially affects certain aspects of the organisation of production. As already noted, a wage system which enlists the co-operation of, and secures an optimum output from, the workers is an essential element in efficient production. In the second place, the wage policy followed determines to a great extent the proportion of the pro&#172; ceeds going to profits; and abnormally high or abnormally low profits necessarily influence the volume and direction of investment. The organisation of trade is likewise influenced to some consider&#172; able extent by the wage policy followed. Differences in wage rates tend to affect international competition, and hence the whole ques&#172; tion of tariffs and trade barriers generally. Again, it is the wage earners who constitute the great majority of buyers of mass-produced goods and services, so that the maintenance of the buying power of this section of the population constitutes a highly important feature in the effective organisation of the marketing of these products. Furthermore, it is this working class element in buying which comes least into the &quot;area of caprice&quot;, the great expansion of which, during recent decades, makes anticipation of the direction of demand of especial difficulty. Here also, therefore, the maintenance of the buying power of wage-earners would tend to simplify the marketing problem very considerably.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The organisation of the division of the product of industry like&#172; wise affects the organisation of the medium of exchange. Where an unduly large proportion of the national dividend goes to rela&#172; tively few people, who tend to invest a major part of their income in producers&apos; goods, a relatively large part of the national effort may thus be directed to the making of equipment, and a relatively small part to the purchase of the goods made by this equipment&#8212; with uneconomic results in the way of unused capital resources. Similarly, people with large incomes are able if they wish to hold a considerable volume of purchasing power idle, thereby reducing effective demand and making for business depression; from which it may be inferred that a less unequal distribution of income would tend to have a beneficial effect upon the maintenance of effective demand. Furthermore, a wage system that enables the remuneration of labour to advance with increasing productivity is a necessary part of any planned monetary system involving approximate stability of the price level, since otherwise such increase in productivity is liable to give rise to profit inflation and so lead to an unbalanced economic situation. Thus, quite apart from the social considerations involved, the organisation of the division of the product of industry, centring around wage questions, is of many-sided importance in economic planning. Along what lines the present haphazard system of wage payment is likely to develop it is, of course, impossible to predict, but the main features of a more satisfactory method may perhaps be distinguished. A wage system giving reasonably satisfactory results from the economic as well as from the social point of view would have to meet four main conditions. It would have to conduce to efficient production; it would have to be of such a nature as to obviate as far as possible &quot;social dumping&quot; by countries with low wages and poor conditions of labour; it would have to ensure that the remuner&#172; ation of labour advanced as productivity increased; and it would have both to be and to appear reasonably just. In order to meet these conditions, some system along the following general lines might possibly be found appropriate. At the basis of the system there would need to be a minimum wage (which was a true minimum</essay:p>

This would have to be accompanied by some system of sharing the surplus remaining once this prime cost of labour had been met, and in such a manner as to secure that an equitable share went to the workers. Furthermore, such a system, while operating necessarily on a national (or regional) basis, would require to be adopted internationally in order to give reasonably satisfactory results. A wage system along these general lines, having a minimum wage as its basis coupled with some form of surplus sharing, would appear capable of meeting the four essential conditions laid down above. In the first place, it renders possible forms of remuneration calcu&#172; lated to secure the co-operation of the workers, thereby making for efficiency of production. In the second place, it would appear to lend itself better than any other system to international agreement on minimum standards, and the prevention, at least to some extent, of &quot;social dumping&quot;. In the third place, it is likely to prove more effective than the present system in maintaining the buying power of workers as a whole and, in particular, would enable wage earners to share in the increasing productivity of industry. In this way, it would both make for a fairer division of the product and tend to prevent profit inflation. Finally, by coupling it with measures (already in operation in a number of undertakings) by which the various types of work are graded as regards remuneration, so as to take into account skill, experience, previous training and other quali&#172; ties required, a reasonably fair adjustment of rates as between differ&#172; ent occupations would appear possible. ***** The above cursory description of some of the problems economic planning is likely to encounter is necessarily hypothetical to a very large extent. It tacitly assumes that a considerable element of pri&#172; vate initiative and private enterprise is likely to be retained, the role of the State being to facilitate industrial self-government, to adapt the monetary system to modern requirements, to secure the necessary international co-ordination of the various measures adopted, and to ensure that the economic advance obtained is put to effective social</essay:p>

For the rest, the survey of the problems made here is very far from being complete, a number of exceedingly delicate and difficult questions&#8212;such as migration&#8212;being left completely on one side; while those actually treated are dealt with only in their more obvious manifestations. On the other hand, it would seem that the problems thus briefly referred to are among the most immediate that economic planning must tackle, and furthermore, that these problems are for the most part so inter-connected that one can hardly be dealt with unless the others are taken into account at the same time. For this reason, an attempt, however imperfect, to get a general view of the field, with the more urgent measures placed prominently in the foreground, has appeared essential to any examination of the inter&#172; national and social aspects of the matter.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>THE INTERNATIONAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF ECONOMIC PLANNING AS with the factors making for economic planning and with the ^A-problems economic planning is likely to involve, the interna&#172; tional and social aspects of the question cannot be more than sug&#172; gested here. But while considerations of space make detailed treat&#172; ment impossible, it would seem necessary to emphasise very strongly that these two aspects of the question are of the utmost importance. Unless adequate account is taken of the international aspect much of the planning conceived on a purely national basis will inevitably tend to defeat itself; and failure to give due attention to the social impli&#172; cations of economic planning is to lose sight of what must necessarily be its ultimate purpose. the international aspect Economic planning may be on a purely national basis, on a purely international basis, or on a basis partly national and partly international. The purely national basis of economic planning has, superficially, much to recommend it. Decisive action is undoubtedly more pos&#172; sible within the narrower boundaries and under the relatively homo&#172; geneous conditions of a single State. But against this there are more than counterbalancing disadvantages. The objections to purely national planning are, in the first place, that the process of attaining the national economic isolation involved would entail a period of great disorganisation, even for the countries most favourably placed in this respect; while for other countries&#8212;particularly the smaller ones with highly specialised industries&#8212;it is practically out of the question except as a very last resort. In the second place, over and above these difficulties of initial adjustment, the benefit derived from the international division of labour would be lost, with an inevitably adverse effect upon the standard of living. In the third place, such a policy of national isolation would be likely to lead to grave politi&#172; cal difficulties, endangering the whole economic, social and political structure, both of individual countries and of the world as a whole.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>At the opposite extreme, a purely international basis for economic planning cannot be looked upon as feasible at the present time. The planning of the world as a single economic unit is an ultimate aim which requires to be clearly helcT in mind, but the view that such an aim can or should be immediately attained is hardly likely to prove a useful basis for practical action. There remains the intermediate course of national action supplemented by international co-operation, which, in a rather uncertain fashion, the various nations are at present attempting to pursue. It is clear that the great majority of the problems considered in the preceding section, while calling essentially for national action, demand, at the same time, a considerable measure of international action if reasonably satisfactory results are to be achieved. Thus, so far as the organisation of production is concerned, the control of the volume and direction of investment has obvious international impli&#172; cations. Again, from the point of view both of the efficient organisa&#172; tion of production and of the efficient organisation of trade, the problem how, and to what extent, international trade shall be con&#172; trolled is of outstanding importance and manifestly calls for a high degree of co-operation between the different countries if it is to be satisfactorily dealt with. In the same field of organisation of trade, the problem of adjusting production to consumption for the various types of products necessarily entails international producers&apos; agree&#172; ments, at least for certain of the basic products, particularly in agri&#172; culture. The organisation of the medium of exchange necessitates international action in all three of its main features. Co-operation between the various countries in sustaining effective demand is neces&#172; sary in order to ensure that the maintenance of active purchasing power on the home market of each country shall be accompanied by the maintenance of active purchasing power on the world market also. Stability of the price level in any one country is exceedingly difficult to attain if, outside that country&apos;s borders, prices are fluctu&#172; ating widely. The achievement of exchange stability, with which the problem of price levels is linked, is even more inevitably an inter&#172; national problem.

            <essay:p>dumping&quot; are concerned, is an international problem of the first order, and one which so far has barely been touched. THE SOCIAL ASPECT The social aspect of economic planning may most conveniently be considered under the several heads of standard of living, unemploy&#172; ment, wage questions, hours of work, conditions of labour, industrial disputes, and the general conception of social justice. Standard of Living. The average standard of living is necessarily governed by the numbers engaged in full-time production, their productivity, and the proportion of this production taking the form of consumers&apos; goods finding buyers. At each of these points there is room for considerable improvement. Under present circumstances, the number engaged in full-time production, as compared with the number that would wish to be so employed, is exceedingly low and, except at rare intervals, tends to remain low. The actual output of those engaged in industry (using the term &quot;industry&quot; in its widest sense) is likewise relatively small as a result of preventable mis&#172; direction, irregularity of production and industrial waste of many descriptions, due to lack of adequate planning. To some extent also, particularly during periods of profit inflation, there is liable to be an excessive proportion of capital equipment in the total production &#8212;resulting, at least temporarily, in the standard of living being lower than would otherwise be the case. Finally, the volume of goods made but subsequently wasted or deliberately destroyed for lack of buyers at remunerative prices, is not inconsiderable. For all these reasons, but principally the first two, the average standard of living falls far short of what would appear attainable under con&#172; siderations slightly less chaotic than those at present obtaining. A second, and in some ways even more important factor from the social point of view, is that the inequalities in the incomes of the various classes of the community result in certain sections having a standard of living bordering upon, or actually falling below, the bare subsistence level. This is particularly true of the large numbers on the margin of employment who, under present circumstances, cannot reckon upon reasonably sustained periods of full-time work.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Economic planning would appear likely to improve the standard of living, both as regards the general average and as regards the levelling up of the lower categories. So far as raising the general level is concerned, the direct improvement in the organisation of production is important; but what is most necessary at the present time is the maintenance of adequate effective demand tending to keep industry reasonably fully employed. Provided this were done, the waste of manpower, of equipment and of materials, inevitable under existing circumstances, would be obviated at least to some extent. This same measure would be of the utmost importance also in bringing about a less unequal division of the product, since it would not only reduce the numbers at present upon the fringe of employment but, by keeping the demand for labour more nearly equal to the supply than at present occurs, would tend to increase the bargaining power of labour&#8212;particularly the lower categories&#8212; and so bring about an improvement in their earnings. The organisa&#172; tion of the division of the product of industry, by way of better methods of wage determination, would likewise not only tend to result in a larger total product, but also ensure a more equitable and less unequal distribution among the various sections of the community. Unemployment. The effect of economic planning upon unemploy&#172; ment would come principally from the organisation of marketing, on the one hand, and the organisation of the medium of exchange on the other. For industry as a whole to keep reasonably fully em&#172; ployed, it is necessary that the production of the various types of goods should not be allowed to proceed at a rate far exceeding the possibility of disposing of those types of goods at prices making production worth while. Still more essential is it that the total volume of active purchasing power shall be continuously adjusted, so as to secure that the effective demand for goods in general shall be adequate but not excessive. Provided these two major conditions are fulfilled, unemployment could be reduced to such minimum of wastage as is inevitable in a changing economy. If, on the other hand, these conditions, particularly the second, are not fulfilled, there must inevitably be periods when for a variety of reasons par&#172; ticular types of goods are produced disproportionately, with the</essay:p>

So long as the process of price-and-cost adjustment could be relied upon to work with a fair degree of efficiency and rapidity, the unem&#172; ployment so brought about, while important, is not disastrous. Under present-day conditions, with price-and-cost adjustment erratic and uncertain, either there must be conscious planning along these general lines, or there is reason to believe that, with the rapid changes in the direction of demand for particular products, the wide fluctuations in total demand, and the rapid rate of technological advance, unemployment may prove a permanent problem and one of growing seriousness. Wage questions. As with the standard of living, almost all of the various forms of economic planning considered in the preceding sec&#172; tion have a profound influence upon wage questions. In the first place, a more efficient organisation of production is, of course, funda&#172; mental to an increase in real earnings. In the second place, as with unemployment, the adjustment of production to consumption for the various types of goods, and the adjustment of consumption to pro&#172; duction for goods in general, are alike essential if the goods made are to find an adequate market, thereby enabling regular and full- time wages to be earned. The approximate stabilisation of the price levels in the various countries is yet another aspect of the organisa&#172; tion of the medium of exchange closely affecting wage questions, since by no other means can money wages be enabled to keep a fairly constant value. Finally, the establishment of principles of wage determination, both nationally and internationally, would be likely to have far-reaching social consequences, affecting both the relations between different sections of the community and the relations between countries. Hours of work. The question of hours of work presents a rather special case of economic planning.

            <essay:p>by technological advance shall be taken in the form of material goods, and to what extent it shall be taken in the form of leisure. This is the major aspect of the question in the long run, but there is also the shorter-run problem arising out of the rapidity of techno&#172; logical advance. In one manner or another it is necessary for the economy of each country and of the world as a whole to be adapted to the changes brought about by labour-saving devices; and one of the possible methods of adaptation is obviously a reduction in hours of work. It is not necessary to enter into the substance of these questions here. The point that requires to be brought out is that any reasonable decision on these questions calls for some measure of planning, inter&#172; nationally as well as nationally, the blind press of competition being altogether inadequate to furnish an economically and socially satis&#172; factory solution. Conditions of labour. The improvement of general conditions of labour, such as those concerning night work, child labour, social insurance, apprenticeship questions, health and safety, etc., depends in the main upon three essential factors: the degree of organisation of the various industries, industry&apos;s ability to sell its goods at remunerative prices, and the ability of labour to insist upon high and improving standards. The first of these factors is manifestly con&#172; nected with the organisation of production, in particular the indus&#172; trial integration of individual enterprises, thereby controlling to some extent the otherwise inevitable percentage of &quot;bad&quot; employers to be found in every industry. The other two factors depend in the main upon a right relationship being maintained between consump&#172; tion and production. Provided industry is able to dispose of its products at remunerative prices, the essential basis for improvement in labour conditions exists. Similarly, provided the demand for goods in general is kept adequate, the consequent adequate demand for labour to make these goods tends to place in the hands of the workers the power necessary to secure the adoption of suitable labour conditions. In this, as in other spheres, economic planning is the essential basis for social advance. Industrial disputes.

            <essay:p>disputes and social unrest generally in a number of ways. Of these, the most important are that, with effective demand fairly consistently sustained, the difficulties, economic and psychological, arising out of fluctuating industrial activity would be eliminated in large part; the fluctuations in the price level, with their effect upon real wages, would likewise cease to play the important role they now have in disturbing industrial relations; and the establishment of principles of wage determination would go far towards preventing a large number of actual and potential disputes&#8212;some two-thirds of the total number of strikes and lock-outs in most countries being directly ascribable to wage questions. Needless to say, economic planning does nothing in itself to alter the combative element basic to indus&#172; trial disputes; but by eliminating a number of factors which at present complicate industrial relations it would tend to some con&#172; siderable extent to prevent disputes arising unnecessarily. Social justice. The relationship between economic planning and social justice is far too wide a question to be dealt with here in any detail. At the same time, it cannot be passed by unnoticed. Two major aspects in particular would appear to merit attention. The better adjustment of consumption and production, by the organisa&#172; tion of marketing on the one hand and the organisation of the medium of exchange on the other, would tend to bring about a levelling up of some of the grosser economic inequalities which at present characterise industrial civilisation. In particular, by reducing unemployment to a minimum the large mass of people at present on the fringe of employment would be placed in a position to earn a relatively regular living. The other outstanding influence of eco&#172; nomic planning upon social justice arises from the increased power that adequate demand for goods in general is likely to put into the hands of the workers. In so far as it is true that justice is seldom done unless those demanding justice have the power to enforce their demands, it is probably not too much to say that the effective attain&#172; ment of some closer approximation to social justice than at present exists depends essentially upon adequate measures of economic plan&#172; ning which, by keeping industry and labour reasonably fully em&#172; ployed, would give those engaged in production the means of having an effective voice in the shaping of the community of the future.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>CONCLUSIONS THE necessarily superficial and incomplete survey attempted in the foregoing pages does not permit of any very positive con&#172; clusions being reached, except such as border upon the platitudinous. Nevertheless, certain of these are not altogether without their im&#172; portance, given that they are as yet far from being universally accepted. The first of these conclusions is that the sheer pressure of facts behind the movement towards economic planning is calculated, sooner or later, to force a large measure of planning upon the more important industrial countries. Muddling through as a permanent policy is incompatible with the modern mentality, is abhorrent to the social outlook and, with the mechanism of adjustment of prices and costs more or less completely out of commission, is no longer capable of giving even moderately satisfactory results. The second outstanding conclusion is that economic planning is fundamental to social progress. Under modern conditions, impro&#172; vised and haphazard methods cannot be relied upon to deal with such basic questions as unemployment and the provision of an adequate living wage. &quot;Economic facts&quot; are not what they were once considered to be&#8212;iron boundaries narrowly circumscribing the possibilities of social advance. On the contrary, these &quot;facts&quot; are now the hope of the future. The prospects opened up by economic planning, in conjunction with modern technology, are such as to bring much that was once pure idealism into the realm of the prac&#172; tically possible. This is not in any way to subscribe to the extrava&#172; gant prophecies of those who generalise over-hastily from recent technological progress in some particular sphere. But there can be little question that, given the necessary organisation, modern indus&#172; trial technique makes possible a rapid advance in living and labour standards; and it is no less certain that the essential aim of organised society&#8212;maximum individual satisfaction at minimum social cost&#8212; can find its achievement only through planning consciously directed to this end.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The third major conclusion is that many of the measures, to be satisfactorily put into action, must be international in scope. This does not necessarily carry with it the guarantee that the requisite international co-operation will be forthcoming; but the need for such action is sufficiently obvious. In the marketing and in the monetary spheres, in particular, international co-operation is both urgent and essential. The fourth conclusion to which the foregoing analysis would appear to lead is that conscious measures aiming at the adjustment of production to consumption so far as individual products are con&#172; cerned, and of consumption to production so far as concerns goods in general, are fundamental to the whole of economic planning. Such a programme involves scientific marketing in combination with industrially integrated production, on the one side, monetary mea&#172; sures combined with appropriate government action, on the other. Unless and until positive action is taken along these general lines, the breakdown of the mechanism of adjustment of prices and costs is likely to have catastrophic consequences. Finally, it must be recognised that some of the most important of the conditions making satisfactory economic planning possible lie outside the economic field. The relations between countries and between different sections of the world community must shew a radical improvement before many of the most necessary features of economic planning become practicable. This in turn involves a widely different outlook upon the part of the individuals of which these countries and sections are made up. Whether and how rapidly the pressure of facts can bring about this changed outlook necessarily depends upon forces the future influence of which is unpredictable.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>EVOLUTION OF IDEAS CONCERNING PUBLIC WORKS THE PROBLEM of public works in relation to unemployment was one of the questions considered by the International Labour Organisation at its inception. At the first International Labour Con&#172; ference, held at Washington in 1919, a recommendation was adopted to the effect that each member of the International Labour Organisa&#172; tion should &quot;co-ordinate the execution of all work undertaken under public authority, with a view to reserving such work, as far as prac&#172; ticable, for periods of unemployment.&quot; The terms of the recommendation are wide in scope. The phrase &quot;all work undertaken by public authority&quot; not only means work carried out directly by the central or local government authorities, but includes all work operated by private bodies under statutory control, such as railways, road transport, gas and electric supply, etc. The object of the recommendation is obviously not to give work to the unemployed when a depression has already developed. What is mainly aimed at is to provide a stimulus to economic organisation as a whole in times of industrial depression, by utilising funds accumulated in preceding periods of boom. This recommendation must be regarded as a landmark in the evolution of the idea of public works as a means of combating unemployment, since it involves an important new principle in the organisation of public works schemes. Throughout the nineteenth century and the first decade of the present century, the construction of local public works was in vari&#172; ous countries a customary practice for alleviating unemployment in periods of depression. An experiment in Lancashire during the cotton famine caused by the American Civil War was, as is often cited, one of the early attempts to undertake public works on a large scale in order to give relief to those who were thrown out of work. With a loan granted by Parliament in 1863, street improvements in cotton towns were carried out by the Lancashire authorities. The scheme was well administered, but the result was very limited from the point of view of mitigating unemployment.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>In pre-war days, relief works similar to the Lancashire experiment were often resorted to in many countries during recurring periods of depression. However, public works proposals hurriedly formulated only when the situation had already reached a point of crisis could not be otherwise than limited in scope and unproductive in result. At the end of the nineteenth century, when it was seen that the economic system was subject to cyclical fluctuations, a new idea was put forward, namely, advance-planning of public works with a view to bringing about the stabilisation of the demand for labour over a period of years. This new principle of public works as a means of reducing unemployment has secured many adherents; and the probable effectiveness of the idea has given rise to considerable discussion among economists and legislators. The earliest measure based on the idea of advance-planning is to be found in France in 1897, but the policy was not consistently pur&#172; sued, and it is probably in Sweden that the most thorough examina&#172; tion and application of this policy among European countries has been made. In Great Britain, both the majority and the minority report issued by the Royal Commission on the Poor Law of 1909 favourably recommended similar measures. The Development and Road Fund Act, 1909, provided for the establishment of a Develop&#172; ment Commission with powers to plan public works in relation to the general unemployment situation, but owing to changed economic conditions no practical results ensued in this respect. Since the recommendation on unemployment, to which reference has already been made, was adopted by the Washington Conference of 1919, the idea of advance-planning for remedying unemployment has been definitely established as an international principle, and this was reaffirmed by the International Labour Conference of 1926.1 In the United States of America, the movement for adopting the principle of advance-planning as a means of industrial stabilisation had its origin in the crisis of 1921-22. At the close of 1921 a bill was introduced into the United States Senate for the first time, enabling the Federal Government to exercise a stabilising influence 1 Problems of public works are the subject of continual study by the International Labour Office. A complete survey of the question is made in Unemployment and Public Works, International Labour Office, Geneva, 1931.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>on cyclical fluctuations of business by postponing or advancing the execution of public works. Later efforts to pass Federal legislation on the subject of advance-planning of public works culminated on February 10, 1931, when the Wagner Act was approved. The Act, which is called the Employment Stabilisation Act, provides for &quot;the advance-planning and regulated construction of public works, for stabilisation of industry, and for aiding in the prevention of unem&#172; ployment during periods of business depression.&quot; Further development has recently taken place in the conception of public works. Some eminent economists have shown the importance of associating public works policy with a suitable monetary policy, as this is believed to be the most effective method of restoring purchasing power, and thereby industrial activity as well.2 In his pamphlet entitled &quot;The Means to Prosperity,&quot; Mr. J. M. Keynes makes a proposal for the use of large-scale public works to be financed by means of loans, national action along these lines to be co-ordinated internationally and combined with world-economic measures of controlled reflation. Using the best calculations obtain&#172; able, Mr. Keynes points out that in Great Britain expenditure on public works of &#163;150 would result, directly and indirectly, in putting an unemployed man to work for a year, and that between one-half and two-thirds of this disbursement would be recovered by the Government in savings on unemployment benefits and increased re&#172; ceipts from taxation. He argues, therefore, that an expenditure amounting to &#163;150,000,000 per annum would result in putting at least one million men back to work. Moreover, Mr. Keynes holds that the only satisfactory method of bringing about an upward move&#172; ment in the prices of commodities as a whole is to increase expendi&#172; ture more rapidly than the supply of commodities on the market, and that such an increase in expenditure can be expected in present circumstances only from the initiative of public authorities. Private enterprise will not expand until profits begin to recover, nor can banks be expected to increase working capital until output increases. 2 Some representative works on the question are as follows:&#8212;P. W. Martin, The Problem of Maintaining Purchasing Power. A Study of Industrial Depression and Recovery, London, 1931; Sir Arthur Salter, Recovery, London, 1932; J. M. Keynes, The Means to Prosperity, London, 1933; J. E. Meade, Public Works in Their Inter&#172; national Aspect, with an introduction by Mr. H. B. Butler, Director of the International Labour Office, London, 1933.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>To bring about a rise in prices, not merely in a single country but in the world as a whole, concerted international action in increasing loan-expenditure is most desirable. As Mr. Keynes indicates, the proposal represents not only his personal view, but the opinion of a group of influential people. In the light of this interesting evolution in the underlying prin&#172; ciple of public works for dealing with unemployment, an examina&#172; tion will be attempted in the following pages of public works policies in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, New Zealand and the United States of America;3 and some important problems which have arisen from the experiences in these countries will also be considered. Each step in the evolution of ideas concerning public works has increased the importance of their international aspect. SURVEY OF MEASURES PROPOSED AND ADOPTED FOR PUBLIC WORKS IN SOME PACIFIC COUNTRIES RECENT economic history suggests that the Pacific countries are very sensitive to recurring industrial depressions, and demon&#172; strates that they were the first to experience the effects of the two post-war depressions of 1920-22 and 1929-33. One of the conspicu&#172; ous features of the post-war depressions seems to be that at the outset a big fall takes place in the prices of foodstuffs and industrial raw materials.4 Many Pacific countries, whose industry consists mainly in the pro&#172; duction of primary products, from the very beginning of the present depression found themselves in a very unfavourable industrial posi&#172; tion in comparison with other parts of the world. The recent price movements of different commodities, indicated in the following table prepared by the League of Nations, illustrate the difficult industrial situation in the Pacific area. 3 For the sake of convenience, these countries are called Pacific countries in this memorandum. 4 For the course of the first post-war crisis, see Jean Lescure, Des Crises generales et periodiques de surproduction, Quatrieme Edition, Tome Premier, Paris, 1932. For an account of the present crisis, see League of Nations, The Course and Phases of the World Economic Depression, Geneva, 1931, and Review of World Trade 1931-32 (first half), Geneva, 1932.</essay:p>

According to trade union statistics, unemployment reached as high as 26.5 per cent, of or&#172; ganised labour in Australia, in May, 1933, and 24.3 per cent, in Canada, in February, 1933. In Japan there were 444,000 workers unemployed in January, 1933, but the statistics seem to exclude certain categories of labourers. In New Zealand the number of applicants for employment registered at Government employment bureaux was 52,096 in April, 1933.6 The total number of unem&#172; ployed in the United States of America is now variously estimated at from thirteen to sixteen million. 5 League of Nations, Review of World Trade, 1931-32 {first half). 6 Of these, 46,784 are in partial employment on public works&apos; schemes. In addition, 15,931 men, not included in the registered number cited above, were in full-time employment with their remuneration wholly or partially paid out of the funds of the Unemployment Board.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>There is no single method of dealing with unemployment. The organisation of public works, however, is generally considered one of the most effective immediate methods of combatting unemploy&#172; ment. It has been extensively resorted to in the Pacific countries; therefore, a survey of the public works&apos; policies pursued in some of the representative industrial countries bordering on the Pacific Ocean is given in the following pages. AUSTRALIA In Australia, public authorities, and in particular the Common&#172; wealth and State Governments, have played a large part in the development of the resources of the country by the construction of public works, mainly out of the proceeds of loans. Foremost among the works undertaken by the State Governments have been the con&#172; struction of railways, the improvement of harbours and rivers, and the construction of water supply and sewerage works. The Common&#172; wealth Government has assumed the responsibility for construction of telephone and telegraph services, the trans-Australian railway, and certain other undertakings. From the outset of the current depression, the decline in national revenue consequent on the heavy fall in export prices, together with the cessation of over-sea borrow&#172; ing, made it difficult to raise funds for expenditure on public works. No statistics are available showing the total expenditure on public works, but the decline in the amount of expenditure on public works by the Commonwealth and State Governments from the proceeds of loans during recent years may be seen from the following table: LOAN EXPENDITURE ON PUBLIC WORKS IN AUSTRALIA, 1926-27 TO 1930-31 7 &#163; (ooo&apos;s) Year All States Commonwealth 1926-27 33,319 9,404 1927-28 35,562 8,662 1928-29 31,873 8,244 1929-30 24,974 5,294 1930-31 12,664 1,991 7 Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics, Official Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia, No. 25&#8212;1932, Canberra, 1933.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>In 1928, the Development and Migration Commission investigated the problem of unemployment and industrial stabilisation. It rec&#172; ommended that the Commonwealth and State Governments adopt the policy of regulating expenditure on public works according to the principle of advanced planning. This recommendation does not appear to have been carried into effect, except that some measures have been adopted against seasonal unemployment in various states. In general, the rate of expenditure on public works appears to have been strongly influenced by the facility with which loans could be raised abroad&#8212;or, in recent years, within the country&#8212;for such purposes. The control of public works is divided between the Commonwealth and the various states, but it is interesting to note that in 1927, as a result of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states with regard to the co-ordination of public borrowing, an Australian Loan Council was established. All loans are now arranged by the Commonwealth in accordance with the decision of the Loan Council, which determines the amount and the conditions of borrowing. The Commonwealth and the various states submit annual programmes indicating the amounts of loan money desired and the amounts expected to be made available for repayment. Only by a unanimous decision of the Council may a state float loans on its own account outside Australia.8 During periods of severe unemployment, efforts are generally made by the state authorities and local bodies to expedite public works with a view to relieving distress among the unemployed. In order to meet the consequences of the present depression, special measures designed to relieve unemployment have been adopted in various states. In New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, unemploy&#172; ment funds have been set up, financed by the proceeds of special taxation on wages, salaries and other incomes and, except in the case of Victoria, by grants from the general revenue of the state. The funds are used in various ways for the relief of unemployment, including the payment of sustenance allowances and the execution of relief works. For example, in New South Wales the expendi- 8 New South Wales, The Official Year Book of New South Wales, 1930-31, Sydney, 1932, p. 682.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>ture from the unemployment fund during 1930-31 amounted to &#163;4,357,000, of which rather more than one-half was spent on various relief works. In South Australia and West Australia, too, special bodies have been set up to undertake measures, such as public works, for the relief of unemployment.9 CANADA In Canada, public works policies have been considered mainly as a means of providing relief for the unemployed, and such works have until recently been the principal relief measure in the country. In October, 1921, when an acute unemployment situation prevailed, an Order in Council was issued, providing that Federal aid to the extent of one-third of the cost would be granted in respect of work undertaken by municipalities during the winter for the purpose of re&#172; lieving unemployment. By Orders in Council of January, 1922, and March, 1926, this system was continued with certain modifications. At a special session of Parliament in September, 1930, called to deal with unemployment, an Unemployment Relief Act was passed, and provision was made for the execution of public works and the extension of cash relief to alleviate unemployment. Other Acts dealing with the same subject were passed in 1931 and 1932. Accord&#172; ing to a report made by the Minister of Labour in the House of Commons, February 24, 1933, on activities under the relief legisla&#172; tion of 1930, 1931 and 1932,10 under the 1930 Act, the Dominion Government contributed to public works a total of $14,396,000, and to cash relief $3,547,000. In August, 1931, the Unemployment and Farm Relief Act, 1931, became effective, and its operation con&#172; tinued until May, 1932. Under this Act, by agreement with the various provinces of the Dominion, the Federal Government agreed to contribute $34,008,000 towards the works carried out by the provinces, municipalities and Federal departments, the total cost of such works being approximately $81,000,000. On the question of continuing the public works on a full-wage basis with joint contributions from the Dominion Government, prov- 9 Cf.

            <essay:p>inces and municipalities, a practically unanimous opinion was ex&#172; pressed by provincial representatives at a conference of Dominion and Provincial Government representatives, held in April, 1932, that this would place too heavy a burden upon the provinces and the municipalities. The Federal Government also was feeling the financial strain; the conference therefore put an end to the whole public works&apos; policy, and cash relief became the chief measure for relieving unemployment throughout Canada. After the conference, however, the Dominion Government launched a policy of land settlement in co-operation with local authorities. Families are selected from among those dependent upon cash relief and placed on the land, where they have a chance of becoming self- supporting. The estimated cost of supporting them by means of cash relief is advanced to help them in establishing themselves. The maximum amount of each advance is set at $600, to be shared equally by the Dominion, provinces and municipalities; not more than $500 is to be paid in the first year, $100 being reserved for the second year, in case of necessity. The total contribution of $200 by the Dominion is not recoverable. CHINA There is a paucity of information concerning public works in China. However, at a meeting of the Committee on Chinese Rev&#172; enue, held on November 29, 1921, during the Washington Confer&#172; ence for limiting naval armaments, a suggestion was put forward by a member of the Committee to the effect that increased revenue from Customs duties might profitably be expended on building railways in China. In reply to this suggestion, it was stated by a Chinese delegate that public opinion in China and the Chinese Government desired that such revenue should be devoted to productive public works. This policy appears to have met with many practical difficulties; but the Chinese Government has not abandoned the hope of employ&#172; ing the increased revenue from Customs duties for constructive pur&#172; poses. Some of the important schemes of public works which the Chinese Government proposes to carry out as soon as the necessary funds are available, are as follows: (1) the completion of the</essay:p>

It was not, however, until 1925 that the Government took more active steps to encourage this policy. In August, 1925, the Government formulated a scheme of public works with the aim of giving relief to unemployed persons. Under this scheme, state financial aid amounting to half the labour costs of public works were granted in six large industrial cities, namely Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Yokohama, Nagoya and Kobe, and the adja&#172; cent districts. Further, the Government helped in carrying out these works by facilitating the floating of loans. Since the main object of these works was to give immediate relief to unskilled manual workers, only those public works the labour costs of which exceed 30 per cent of the total cost of the works were entitled to receive the state grant. The works were usually commenced in December of each year and continued until the end of March in the following year, which is the end of the fiscal year. This policy was continued without much modification until 1929. In the summer of 1929, a change of Government occurred; and the new Government, with Mr. Inouye as Minister of Finance, adopted a policy of retrenchment. In spite of the deflationary policy to which the Government committed itself, however, great progress was made with public works for the purpose of relieving the unem&#172; ployed. Some of the important changes made in the public-works policy were: (1) the Government decided to extend the state aid to other parts of the country, in addition to the six industrial cities, 11 Based on Constructive Measures, prepared originally for the special Customs Conference held in Peking.

This Minseito Government fell in December, 1931, and was suc&#172; ceeded by the Seiyukai Government, the financial policy of which was the exact opposite of that of its immediate predecessor. This Government&apos;s policy was definitely inflationary: the gold standard was abandoned, sinking fund payments were suspended, and a budg&#172; etary deficit was met by borrowing. These financial policies, as well as a large programme of public works formulated by this short&#172; lived Government, were taken over by the present Government, which came into power in May, 1932. The scheme of public works requires five years for completion, and the total cost is estimated at 356 million yen.

            <essay:p>reference may be made in this connection to an article by Dr. Seki, the Mayor of Osaka and a well-known authority on social problems, who concludes that public works for relieving unemployment in Japan are still based on the old idea of &quot;making work,&quot; and not on the conception of regularising production and thus diminishing the fluctuations in the amount of unemployment. Further, in Dr. Seki&apos;s view the works have in most cases been carried out uneconomically and have benefited only casual workers.14 NEW ZEALAND In New Zealand, as in Australia, the state has played a large part in the economic development of the country, by the construction not only of roads and bridges, but also of railways and telegraphs, and the carrying out of other developmental works. Municipal and other local authorities also have carried out a great deal of work of this kind. The part played by private enterprise in the construc&#172; tion of works of public utility has, in fact, been a very minor one; and the experience of New Zealand in this respect affords a striking contrast with that of other countries, such as Canada and the United States, where private capital and organisation have been of primary importance. Before 1870, the responsibility for public-works construction was in the hands of the provincial and local authorities; but in that year the Dominion Government took over the function formerly exer&#172; cised by the provincial authorities in this connection, and set up a Public Works Fund to develop public construction. The activities of the Department of Public Works since that time have been on such a scale as to command much attention and constitute one of the major elements of Governmental policy. A Public Works Statement, containing detailed accounts and statistics, is presented by the Depart&#172; ment to Parliament each year. During the period from 1870 to 1932, the total net expenditure from the general funds of the Department amounted to 121 million pounds. Approximately one-half of this total was spent in the con&#172; struction of railways, 17 per cent on roads, 9 per cent on telegraphs, &quot;Hajime Seki, &quot;Shitsugyo Kyusai Jigyo (Works for Relieving Unemployment)&quot; Shakat Setsaku Jiho, November, 1932, pp. 20-58.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>stages of the depression, the Public Works Department carried out schemes of road building in undeveloped areas. The persistence of severe unemployment led to the adoption in 1930 of an Unemploy&#172; ment Act, which provided for a special fund to be expended in ways designed to stimulate employment. The sums set aside for this pur&#172; pose proved to be insufficient, in view of the progressive increase in unemployment; and amending legislation imposed special taxation on all wages and incomes, in addition to a general levy on adult male workers. The Unemployment Fund constituted by the proceeds of this taxation is administered by an Unemployment Board which, in addition to carrying out land-developmental work in co-operation with the Lands Department, subsidises certain public-works expendi&#172; tures by local authorities and also contributes toward the labour cost of certain developmental and reclamation work on private property. The total expenditure from the Unemployment Fund for the relief of the unemployed was &#163;313,000 in the year 1930-31, and &#163;2,217,000 in the year 1931-32. The total expenditures incurred by the Government for the relief of unemployment&#8212;almost entirely by the provision or subsidy of public works&#8212;have been as follows during the past five years: 1927-28, &#163;482,000; 1928-29, &#163;803,000; 1929-30, &#163;1,416,000; 1930- 31, &#163;1,713,000; 1931-32, &#163;3,204,000.19 UNITED STATES Information relating to the development of public-works policies in the United States is incomplete. During the period of unemploy&#172; ment in 1914-1915, about one hundred cities carried out different kinds of public works&#8212;such as road-making, drainage, building, etc.&#8212;but the results were not very satisfactory. It was not until the depression of 1921 that serious efforts were made to promote works in order to relieve unemployment. In that year, President Harding called a conference to study the problem of unemployment. The conference recommended the launching an an extensive pro&#172; gramme of public works, and the Federal Government made a grant to the states for increasing road construction, Congress voting 19 New Zealand, Unemployment Board: Report, 1932, Wellington, 1933, p. 9.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>$75,000,000 for the purpose. The grants required the voting of an equal amount by the states concerned. The result was that 6,261 miles of roads were built at a total cost of $250,000,000, and the expenditure provided employment for about 200,000 workers during 1922. In the spring of 1923, when a shortage of labour was experi&#172; enced in the building industries, President Coolidge applied to Mr. Hoover, Secretary of the Department of Commerce, for advice as to the time when it would be opportune to put in hand Federal con&#172; struction works. In reply, Mr. Hoover recommended that the differ&#172; ent divisions of the Government initiate no new work that was not necessary, and that there be a slowing down of the work in progress until there was a relaxation in private demands for labour. The effect of this letter was the postponement of a large amount of construction work until 1924, when a business recession took place. At the end of 1929, when the present depression started, President Hoover asked the Governors of various states to inaugurate an exten&#172; sive public-works policy in order to mitigate unemployment; and at the same time he held a series of conferences with representatives of finance, trade, industry, agriculture and labour for the same purpose. In 1930, the Federal Government increased the amount of Federal aid to the states for highway construction from $75,000,000 to $125,000,000 a year, for a period of three years. Besides, the Federal programme for building post offices and other structures throughout the country was considerably increased. Thus, unusual efforts were made by the Federal Government to reduce unemployment by means of big schemes of public works, but these schemes do not appear to have been very effective. One reason for this may be that state and municipal expenditures on public works did not keep pace with Federal expenditure. In an address before the annual meeting of the American Association for Labour Legislation, held in December, 1931, Mr. Arthur D. Gayer, of the National Bureau of Economic Research, said that &quot;the total volume of public works throughout the country, Federal, state and local, during 1930, the first full year of the depression, showed only the most trifling increase over 1929, and was actually below the level of the years 1928 and 1927. In the latter year they aggregated</essay:p>

In advising the President, the Board will take into consideration the volume, based upon value, of contracts awarded for construction work in the United States during any three-monthly period in comparison with the corresponding three-monthly period of the three previous calendar years; and it may take into consideration the index of employment prepared by the Department of Labor, and any other information which it may have at its disposal. Whenever the President finds that a period of busi&#172; ness depression and unemployment is imminent, he is requested to ask Congress for the necessary monetary appropriation to be ex&#172; pended upon construction, in order to aid in preventing unemploy&#172; ment and permit the Government to avail itself of the opportunity for speedy, efficient and economical construction during the period of depression. The adoption of the Employment Stabilisation Act has drawn the attention of state and municipal authorities to the subject of advance planning. The Massachusetts Commission on Stabilisation of Em&#172; ployment recommends in its report the establishment of a Public Works Planning Board, to formulate five-year public-works plans in order to provide more work in time of depression. A suggestion of a similar nature has been made in reports published by the Pennsyl&#172; vania Committee on Unemployment, the Wisconsin Legislature Interim Committee on Unemployment, and the California State Unemployment Commission.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>CONCLUSIONS NATIONAL POLICIES RELIEF WORKS AS HAS been seen, construction schemes in Australia, Canada and -^A. other Pacific countries have been carried out by public authori&#172; ties as an alternative to distributing cash relief. This policy has not been abandoned, but the experience of the countries which have adopted it seems to be that it is not possible to relieve the unem&#172; ployed during a long depression in this way, owing to the cost, and that direct cash relief has to be given. It would, however, be a great mistake to underestimate the utility of this kind of work. A great deal has been done; and in particular the efforts made in some winters during and after the crisis of 1920-22, and also during the present depression, were of consider&#172; able value in remedying seasonal unemployment and in helping dis&#172; tressed workers to tide over a difficult period. ADVANCE-PLANNING With the exception of the United States, no country has yet adopted legislation embodying the idea of advance-planning. But efforts have been made in a number of countries, particularly in Europe, to apply such a policy in practice.25 The general tendency in Australia, Canada and New Zealand has been to proceed with public construction on a large scale during periods of prosperity, while in time of depression expenditure on such works has been much curtailed, consequently aggravating the decline of purchasing power. In the Far East, &quot;measure income and regulate outlay thereby,&quot; which is an old Chinese axiom, is still regarded as the first principle for balancing revenue and expenditure within the fiscal year; and it appears that this is a strong obstacle to the introduction of a budgetary system which takes due account of economic fluctua&#172; tions. In the United States, the advantage of advance-planning has 25 See, on this subject, International Labour Office, Unemployment and Public Works, Part I.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>long been recognised; but the practical results have not been as satisfactory as might be expected. The total expenditure on public works, as it has been pointed out, has shown a decrease during the present depression. This is said to be due to an imperfect co-ordina&#172; tion of policies among the Federal, state and local authorities; and a large proportion of post-war public construction in the country was closely associated with the movement of population from rural to urban areas during the boom.26 Thus, the principle of advance-planning has not yet been given a fair trial in the Pacific countries. However, the difficulties seem to be mainly of a technical character. If certain administrative and financial reforms could be introduced the success of the scheme of advance-planning of public works would be assured. In their report, published in 1930, the Committee on Recent Economic Changes of the President&apos;s Conference on Unemployment, accepting Mr. Leo Wolman&apos;s estimate that about $3,500,000,000 are expended every year on public construction in the United States, and that about 900,000 men are annually employed, pointed out that this public expenditure on permanent improvements formed about 35 per cent of the total volume of expenditure on all private and public con&#172; struction.27 An intensive study on the construction work of the Municipality of Philadelphia shews that approximately one-half of this expenditure can be advanced or retarded.28 These investigations clearly suggest the possibility of considerable results from the adop&#172; tion of a policy of advance-planning; if a certain part of this big expenditure is deferred during periods of prosperity and incurred in periods of depression, the purchasing power thus distributed would do much to compensate for the decline in private business activity. Among many important administrative problems connected with public works, reference can here be made to only three particularly important matters. They are (a) the importance of statistics, (b) 26 Leo Wolman, Employment Stabilisation Through Public Works, in &quot;Stabilisation of Employment,&quot; edited by C. F. Roos, Bloomington, Indiana, 1933. 27 See table on page 20. 28 W. N. Loucks, The Stabilisation of Employment in Philadelphia Through the Long-Range Planning of Municipal Improvement Projects, Philadelphia, 1931, p. 187.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>the need for administrative co-ordination, and (c) methods of financing. The importance of statistics. Reliable data are essential to estab&#172; lish any satisfactory plan for spreading a public-works programme over a period of years. Above all, it is of great importance to have adequate statistical information concerning the state of the labour market. No country in the Pacific area seems to have introduced thus far a satisfactory system of compiling unemployment statistics; and considerable difficulty is experienced in forming an exact idea of the trend of seasonal and cyclical unemployment in these countries. It has already been noted that the United States Employment Stabili&#172; sation Board is required by law to study various kinds of statistics in preparing suggestions for the President. In order to be able to deter&#172; mine the volume of public works to be put in hand, and the most suitable time of execution, correct knowledge of the employment conditions in a wide area and in as many industries as possible must be acquired. Therefore, too much stress cannot be laid on the need for unemployment statistics. In most of the countries, trade union returns of unemployment and the employment exchange records are available, but these statistics are not usually adequate for measuring the volume of unemployment in the whole of a country. The most accurate unemployment statistics are undoubtedly those based on a national scheme of unemployment insurance. Moreover, statistical information about expenditure on public works does not, in most Pacific countries, exist in a form accessible to everybody; and there is an urgent need to establish a central source of information on the subject. In certain countries, individual investigators have undertaken special enquiries into the question of expenditure on public construction. The results of these studies are very illuminating, because from them we can learn how payments for construction purposes have been made in relation to employment conditions in various countries.29 29 Cf.

            <essay:p>For the future, the most desirable arrangement would seem to be that each Government should be responsible for the compilation and publication of statistics of expenditure on public works incurred by different departments and other public agencies, together with any useful information relating to the matter. Further, an international agreement should be reached on the method of compiling these statistics, so that as far as possible they may be on a comparable basis. The need for administrative co-ordination. One of the practical difficulties with which the.public-works policy in the United States and elsewhere has had to contend in the past has been the multiplicity of authorities responsible for planning and carrying out such works. As has already been pointed out, the tendency of public construction in the United States to decline during the present depression is chiefly due to the policy pursued by the state and municipal authori&#172; ties. It is also the universal experience in almost every country that several departments of the central Government undertake public works without any deliberate co-operation in determining the time of execution, and that there are many local authorities which are very likely to inaugurate public improvements whenever the necessary funds become available, and curtail the work as soon as a depression arrives. An extreme example of decentralised administration, accord&#172; ing to Dr. Wolman, is to be found in the City of Chicago and Cook County, where about 415 independent or semi-independent local governing bodies have the power to levy taxes and borrow money for the purpose of public works.30 The situation becomes more serious when we realise that the aggregate capital expenditure controlled by local or municipal bodies far exceeds that of a central government. For example, in the United States, Federal construction work usually represents less than one per cent of the total amount in the country as a whole. How&#172; ever, the creation of the Federal Employment Stabilisation Board in the United States, and the proposals for establishing State Boards of a similar character will undoubtedly do much to remove the greater part of the administrative difficulties. In Japan, the lack of administrative co-ordination connected with public works has largely been removed by the creation of a govern- so Leo Wolman, op. cit., p. 162.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>ment commission to which all public-works projects initiated by local municipal authorities must be referred for examination. Without the approval of this commission, public authorities are not allowed to float loans for the purpose of carrying out public works. In this connection, it may be recalled that reference has already been made to the activities of the Public Works Department in New Zealand and the Loan Council in Australia. Methods of financing. The advance-planning of public works must always be based on a somewhat elastic method of financing. Necessary funds may be raised either by taxation or by loans, but the most important point is that the system of financing should be so flexible as to allow concentrated spending in times of depression. The creation of a special reserve fund is often suggested as an effective means of giving the necessary elasticity to the method of taxation. Thus, it has been proposed that, when money is voted for a public-works scheme, a portion of the annual appropriation should be reserved in order to vary annual expenditure according to general industrial conditions prevailing at the time. By adopting this kind of measure, a heavy increase of taxation for the purpose of public works may be avoided during a depression, but no country has so far introduced such a system of financing on a considerable scale. When industry is actually suffering from a serious depression, a considerable increase in taxation is very difficult from the practical point of view. Moreover, there is theoretical doubt as to whether or not a reinforcement of active purchasing power, which is essential for industrial recovery, can really be brought about by means of public works financed out of taxation. On the other hand, many economists believe that loans should be raised for public-works pur&#172; poses in times of depression. Another point which merits particular consideration is the special situation of debtor countries. In Australia, Canada and New Zeal&#172; and, for example, a large amount of foreign capital was introduced before the present depression for settling people on the land, and for developing public construction. The prices of export products of those countries having fallen most severely, the payment of inter&#172; est on existing debts has become very difficult. Since creditor coun&#172; tries are not inclined to lend more capital, and debtor countries</essay:p>

            <essay:p>cannot continue to export gold, these countries have felt obliged to resort to drastic economic measures, such as serious retrenchment in public expenditure, higher tariffs, exchange restrictions, currency depreciation, etc., thus giving rise to grave economic complications. It would seem from this that the financing of public-works schemes in debtor countries is a problem which needs a special solution. Since the war, the United States has become a great capital-export&#172; ing country. A considerable part of American capital invested abroad in recent years was used in promoting public construction in Europe and in South America. Germany, in particular, borrowed heavily from the United States between 1925 and 1930, and the funds were used to a large extent by states and municipalities for various schemes of public development. No doubt can be enter&#172; tained as to the part played by American investment in economic reconstruction in Central European countries, but it has been sug&#172; gested that this has contributed to the creation of a rather unsatis&#172; factory situation there. In the realm of international finance, laissez- faire was, up to recent times, the guiding principle, and the flow of capital from one country to another was only regulated by the prospect of earning a higher rate of interest. But at present this principle does not seem to work, either in theory or in practice. An early return to the free operation of international lending and bor&#172; rowing is often proposed as a method of escaping from the present depression; but there is also considerable support for the idea of setting up machinery for the purpose of controlling international loans. There can be no doubt that such action is of importance in the financing of public works.81 INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS The description and discussion of the public works policies in Pacific countries would be incomplete without some reference to the international aspects of the subject. The above survey shows that the Pacific countries have had a great deal of experience in applying public works for the relief of unemployment, but it seems that there has been no positive action directed towards the co-ordina- 31 Sir Arthur Salter, op. cit., pp. 86 to 121.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>tion of national schemes of public works for a common purpose. It is true that some of the Pacific countries are large enough to be regarded as to some extent economically independent, especially in comparison with most of the European countries; but the present world-wide depression has shown that isolated national efforts are not sufficient for coping with serious unemployment. It has already become a platitude to speak of the interdependence of nations. If it is clear that no country can any longer be entirely master of its own fate, and that its economic welfare is always dependent upon the conduct of other people, each country must be prepared to recognize and accept the fact and should co-operate in establishing an appropriate system of common action. The International Labour Office has, since the end of 1930, con&#172; centrated its attention on the possibility of carrying out national and international public works capable of appreciably decreasing the number of unemployed. During the last year of his life, Mr. Albert Thomas, the first Director of the International Labour Office, devoted himself to a plan for securing concerted international action in the promotion of public works. Very recently, at the session of the International Labour Conference held in Geneva in June, 1933, a resolution was adopted in favour of taking up the problem of public works as one of the subjects for discussion at one of its next sessions. Moreover, the World Monetary and Economic Conference, which is sitting at the time of writing this report, has on its agenda the question of public works considered as a means of reinforcing effec&#172; tive demand and so making for business revival and an increase in employment. If, as a result of the resolution of the International Labour Con&#172; ference mentioned above, the Governing Body of the International Labour Office places this question on the agenda of a future session of the Conference, attention will be concentrated on the framing of a permanent international policy to which the Governments will be invited to adhere. It would be altogether premature for us to attempt here any detailed examination of what that policy should be; but it seems likely that it will embody the principles of advance planning and of some permanent means of co-ordinating national policies on this matter.</essay:p>
