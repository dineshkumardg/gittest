            <essay:p>CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION The development of the study on the standard of living and t&apos;he cost of living in Japan is comparatively reCent. Scarcely a dozen years ago, the investigation of subjects relating to elconomic consumption was in an embryonic stage. In 1918, when my thesis on &quot;The Standard of Living in Japan&quot;1 was published by the Johns Hopkins Press, certain economic journals in western countries greeted it with the observation that it was the first research relative to economic consumption in Japan.2 Since then, notable studies in the other fields of economics have been published almost in profusion. However none of the treatises (on the subject relating Ito the Japanese&apos; standard of living have, to the best of my belief, appeared as yet, in English, German or French. Even in Japanese the works in this field are very limited and we can recall only a few reports worth mentioning as being investigations covering a larger field and Carried on in a scientific way.3 In 1929&#8212;1930, a memorahle investigation was conducted by the Gov&#172; ernment Statistical Bureau. It is Ithej most valuable and extensive work on the standard of living ever undertaken in Japan. The study covers a total of 5,455 families, including 1,575 families of salaried people, 3,210 wage-earners&apos; families and those of 670 farmers. Those studies were carefully selected from among such families having from two to six memhers each and wkh monthly incomes of less than &#165;200. At the request of the government authorities each of them, from September, 1926, to&quot; August, 1927, undertook to keep ,a detailed record of daily expenditures. Three volumes of Ithe report have already heen issued &apos;and a final Volume is due sometime this year.4 1.

            <essay:p>Progress in ithe study of the standard of living has, on the whole, been tomparatively slow in Japan. This is chiefly due to the tradition.; 1 Japanese attitude toward economic life which came to be held in very low esteem, presumably as a result of overstressing the spiritual aspects of life. In former times peasants, wiage^ earners, ,and ihose whose standards of living were at the bare subsistence level were taught to &apos;content themselves with their predestined lot. Under the influence of such fatalism even the intel&#172; lectual classes were not aroused to the importance of making any study of the standard of living. A different situation exists to&apos;day. It is interesting to observe the changes that have taken place in the social attitude, toward the problems oif economic consumption. The cry for the betterment of elconomic life is heard on all si&apos;des. Even those who have regular employment find their incomes insufficient notwithstanding t&apos;he fact that they may look twice at every penny before they spend it. Under these circumstances there arose more comprehensive efforts to measure the changes in the cost of living. Such Calculation calls for: &quot;(i) more or less accurate information on wfiat people buy to satisfy the daily needs of subsistence; (2) accurate information with regard t&apos;o the prices which consumers must pay for the articles and services which enter into the cost of living.&quot;5 The cost of living, &apos;hoiwever, must be distinguished from the standard o&apos;f living. A low cost of living does not signify necessarily a low standard olf living. For economic progress it is even desirable thalt the (cost of living should be low and the standard of living high. The purpose of this study is t&apos;o secure a picture of t&apos;he present situation of economic living in Japan among various groups of Japanese; to determine what constitutes an efficient standard of living in Japan; and then wbat will be the best possible means of raising the present standard &apos;of living to a standard of efficiencv. 5.

            <essay:p>, CHAPTER II If: THE THEORY OF THE STANDARD OF LIVING i. The Standard of Living and the Cost of Living &apos; The standard of living is the expression of the complex thought of thalt measure of living conditions which greatly differs according to the differences of the individual, the time and the place. &quot;It is, in essence, a psychological thing, a concept more or less definite, represented in material life by those nelcessaries and comforts which a man has become accustomed to regard as his right and without which he would not consider life worth while.&quot;1 Evidently, the standard of living and the tost &apos;of living are, though often confused, not the same thing. The former &quot;is a relative phrase depending not upon the amount of income and expendiltures of a family but also on its attitude toward life.......A family with a small income frequently has a higher standard and&apos; lives more comfortably than another family with a much larger income.&quot;2 2. The Concept of Standard of Living The confusion as to the concept of the standard of living mainly arose from the fact that it depends on three conditions; namely, individual, terri&#172; torial and chronological. Even when care is taken to treat the subject in their definite limits of place and time, the individual conditions seem almost infintely variable because they &apos;are governed by personal taste, character, education, religion, society, wealth, etc. Thus investigators of the standard of living must often feel as if tthey were thrown into hopeless confusion, and their conclusions will be nothing more than that &quot;every man has his own standard of living.&quot;3 Notwithstanding this confusion and difficulty, if we proceed by the proper method of investigation, a certain definite standard of living may be discernible through the maze of facts. That this standard can be deter&#172; mined is possible for the following reasons: (I) A certain .common nature of man as a human being produces, consciously or unconsciously, obvious similarity in his economic activities in spite of a wide diversity in his outward manner of living. (2) Owing to the fact that &quot;man is a social animal,&quot; he instinctively 1. H. P. Shearman: Practical Economics, 2nd ed., p. 409. 2. L. B. More; Wage-Earners&apos; Budgets, p. 123. 3. F. H.

            <essay:p>creates many social relations, and a process of social assimilation is all the time at work. (3) Men are, by nature, imitative of one another. This inclination of human nature is always working physiologically. Whether voluntary or involuntary, this imitation results in a great degree of uniformity. This uniformity of human activities aids in the scientific research of the standard of living. Since the nature o&apos;f this investigation is so complicated we must begin with the study of the origin of all the activities of economic life; namely, human wants. Marshall has well said that &quot;the term the standard of life is here taken to mean the standard oi activities adjusted to wants.&quot;4 Cornish also states that &quot;the standard of life of a family or an individual represents the number and character of wants customarily satisfied.&quot;0 Ely goes still further by saying &quot;the number and character of the wants which a man considers more important than marriage and family constitute his standard of life.&quot;6 Really, human activities which are constituents of the standard of living are nothing more than expressions of wants. So, in order to enter into an analytical study of the subject, let us make an approach by discussing the divisions of want. Roscher&apos;s well known classification of wants is a three-fold division: Natur = , Anstands = und Luxusbedurfnisse (necessity, decency, and luxury).7 Yet we must remember that, it is now more than three quarters of a century since the publication of his valuable book in 1854, and that during that period a unique progress of civilization has taken place. Human wants too, in that space of time, have made remarkable strides both in quality and quantity. Simple ways of living, however inexpensive they may be, will be no longer considered as economical in the present age of &quot;efficiency first.&quot; Naturally, the conception of luxury is now so modified as to include two ideas: first, the wants for &quot;comfort,&quot; and secondly, the wants for &quot;luxury proper.&quot; I thus use a four-fold division: (1) necessity, (2) decency, (3) comfort or efficiency, (4) luxury. 3. The Pauper Standard of Life The &quot;want for necessity&quot; is the feeding of deficiency in those things necessary for bare existence. It exhibits itself chiefly in the desire for the food, shelter, &apos;and clothing which are physiologically necessary to prevent 4. A. Marshall: Principles of Economics, 1916, p. 689. S.

            <essay:p>physical deterioration. The mode and scale of activities adjusted to the wants for necessity will be termed the pauper standard of life, or primitive life standard. The life of aborigines does not generally extend much beyond this standard. They are contended if their wants for bare subsistence are satisfied. According to the view of modern life, the people on this standard are only in a state of existence and not that of living. The numher of people belonging to this group in Japan as well as in a rich country like America is surprisingly great. Parmelee says &quot;We have plenty of evidence that the number of those who do not even reach the lower minimum standard of living is very great, probably exceeding 10% of the population.&quot;8 The nature of their living conditions is well stated by Prof. Hollander in his remarkable book, &quot;The Abolition of Poverty,&quot;9 thus, &quot;There are great hodies of people in country and in city who from birth have less than enough food, clothing, and shelter; who from childhood must toil long and hard to secure even that inefficient amount; who can benefit little from the world&apos;s advance in material co&apos;mfort and in spir&apos;tual beauty, because theirl bodies are undernourished, their minds are overstrained and their souls deadened by bitter struggle and want. These are the real poor of every community&#8212;the masses who, not lacking in industry and thrift, are yet never really able to earn enough for decent existence and who toil on in constant fear that bare necessities may fail.&quot; 4. The Minimum Standard of Life By the increase of human knowledge and the influence of the advance&#172; ment of civilization, human wants gradually extend to include more than the things necessary for a bare existence, such as decency, comfort, and luxury. Each person, as a member of society, has to satisfy his want for decency in order to keep up his or her social position. We must, in other words, maintain a minimum standard &quot;in keeping with the dignity of a human being.&quot;10 This mode and scale of activities, adjusted to&apos; the wants for necessity and decency, will he termed the minimum standard of living, or simple Ufe standard. 5. The Efficiency Standard of Life Civilized man is not satisfied with the plane of decent living only. He desires to enjoy a certain scale of comfort which he considers indispensable 8.

The mode and scale of activities, adjusted to his wants for necessity, decency, and comfort, will be termed the efficiency standard of living, or &quot;Kulturleben&quot; standard.11 This standard corresponds to that described by the National Industrial Conference Board as &quot;the so-called standard of health and decency, which is one not yet generally found in Ithe families of unskilled laborers, but which h the goal toward which they are striving.&quot;12 To quote Cornish, he describes it as &quot;the health and comfort standard&quot; and adds &quot;this plane of life provides not only for the material wants of man, such as food, shelter, and body covering, but also fo&apos;r some comforts&#8212;clothing that is at onoe respectable and comfortable; insurance that takes care of the major misfortunes of life; and a degree of some education as well as amuse&#172; ments.&quot;13 We must remember that &quot;comfort is different from luxury. Comfort it always essential and important for efBciency because the satisfaction of the wants for comfort results in producing more efficiency, directly or indirectly. It may be necessary to devote a comparatively large sum of money to the securing of comfort, but the result of the expenditure will prove profitable by giving high vitality and great energy.&quot;14 This standard calls for the minimum amount of the requirements in a balanced diet with sufficient nutrition in terms of calories, proteins, fats, vitamins, etc. It also calls for the same sort of requirements in the case of housing, clothing and the other elements of living. It is to the level of this ideal standard that we are striving to raise up the actual standard, and we are sure that &quot;gradually, by processes of education, advertising, and propaganda, new habits and custo&apos;ms can be formed which square with the ideal standards.&quot;10 6. The Luxury Standard of Life There is what may be designated the luxury standard of living. It is the mode and scale of activities adjusted to the wants for luxury beside those of necessity, decency, and comfort. &quot;Luxury, while variously defined, involves always the thought of great consumption of wealth for unessential pleasures.&quot;1(&gt;; or, &quot;luxury is altogether unessential superfluous wants.&quot;&quot;17 It 11.

            <essay:p>should he excluded from the efficiency, or comfort, standard though many people like to indulge in luxury. Some scholars, such as Leroy Beaulieu and McCulloch, insist that luxurious expenditure is beneficial and that it is necessary for the advancement1 of social life. &quot;To make men industrious &#8212;to make them shake off that lethargy which benumbs their faculties, even in a rude or depressed condition, they must be inspired wjth a taste for the comforts, luxuries, and enjoyments of civilised life.&quot;18 But I can never be an apologist for luxury. With Laveleye I stand as its opponent. The effect of luxury on the individual is to discourage the spirit of steadiness and sobriety, to cause lavish expenditures in family budgets, and to undermine health. Socially the effect of luxury is as follows: it decreases the wealth-producing power of the nation; it brings about higher prices for commodities; it increases the importation of foreign goods; and it disturbs social peace. 7. Rise in the Standard of Living Since the standard, of living is a certain condition of activities adjusted to wants, &quot;a rise in the standard of life implies an increase of intelligence and energy and self-respect; leading to more care and judgment in expendi&#172; ture and to an avoidance of food and drink that gratify the appetite but afford no&apos; strength, and of the ways of living that are unwholesome physically and morally.&quot;19 Men strive hard to raise their* standard of living to the efficiency level and then they &quot;will struggle much harder to prevent their standard&apos;s falling than they will struggle to raise it.&quot;20 A rise in the standard of life for the whole population brings about a corresponding increase of national prosperity and consequently an advancement of civilization, which will again in turn induce people to strive for a higher standard of living. Such being the case, rises in the standard of living and in the progress of civilization move forward hand in hand reacting alternately on onei another as cause and effect. 8. Population and the Standard of Living The standard of living has much to do with the theory of population. For the study of this subject there are at least two principles which must be observed. 18.

            <essay:p>(i) Growth of population tends to keep the standard of living at the point of bare subsistence. This is a natural outcome of the Malthusian theory insisting that the potential increase of population is indefinitely greater than the power of producing food. The congestion of population and the prevalence of the pauper standard of living in oriental nations illustrate the validity of this principle. (2) Growth of population tends to be checked by the effort to raise the standard of living. One of the strongest motives for human activities is the desire to enjoy a higher standard of life. Many would rather sacrifice marriage and the procreation of children in order to maintain a high standard of living. Recently, the standard of living has been steadily rising because by the use of modern inventions and mass production prices have been reduced to such a point as to attract purchasers with even small incomes to buy com&#172; modities and services formerly only within reach of the luxury class. The high standard, once maintained, will be tenaciously adhered to and relin&#172; quished only with the utmost reluctance. In order to enjoy the comfort standard of life, civilized people will as a whole make sacrifices such as the postponement of marriage and the begetting of children. The birth-control movement and knowledge is disseminated principally among people of the upper classes. Eventually, &quot;The desire to maintain and raise the standard of life is the most effective motive limiting population in our society.&quot;21 It has also heen said that &quot;a high quality of population is in another sense a cause, and not merely an effect, of a high standard of consump&#172; tion.&quot;&quot; There are, at the present time, many countries influenced by the first principle and suffering from overpopulation and a low standard of living. There are also some countries influenced by the second principle and characterized by small families and a high standard of living. It is important to get a balanced ratio hetween population and the standard of living in harmony with the ever active process of social evolution. 21. Fetter: Econom&apos;ic Principle, p. 4-18. 22.

            <essay:p>CHAPTER III FAMILY INCOME More and more attention, scientific and practical, is now being paid to the question,&#8212;What does it cost to live? In embarking on the study of this problem, it must be rememibered that the question is of a complicated nature, because it depends upon at least four things: first, &quot;where to live&quot;; second, &quot;when to live&quot;; third, &quot;how to live,&quot; and fourth, &quot;who to live.&quot; Relating to &quot;where to live,&quot; the economic distance is daily becoming shortened by the rapid progress in means of transportation. The differences in the living cost in different localities are thus becoming year by year less conspicuous. The changeable nature of the living cost due to the influence of &quot;when to live&quot; is a well known fact, but it can, to a certain degree, be adjusted by the use of the index] num&apos;bers of the cost of living which will be treated in Chapter V. For &quot;how to live,&quot; we have divided the scales of living cost into four grades corresponding to the four different standards of living described in the previous chapter. The main purpose of this investigation is to find out the cost of maintaining the efficiency, or comfort, standard of living. This standard is, however somewhat theoretical and it must be ascertained by the deter&#172; mination of the actual cost of family expenditures which is naturally con&#172; trolled by the amount of the family income. With the progress of capitalistic civilization the influence of the family income is becoming not only more powerful but is, at present, the leading determinant of the living cost. Most of the estimates of family incomes in Japan which will be treated in this chapter are taken directly, or adapted, from the reports by the Bureau of Statistics.1 Considering the nature of the subject it must be admitted that such estimates can represent no more than approximations and such figures are useful only in explaining the general situation. The average national income in Japan in 1925, according to the calculation of the Bureau of Statistics, was &#165;224 per capita and &#165;1,124 per family. These figures may be compared with those of certain foreign countries as shown in the following table: 1. (a) Naikaku-Tokeikyoku: Kokumin-Shotoku, (Bureau of Statistics: National Incomes in 1925), 1928. (b) Naikaku-*T6keikyoku: Kokufu-Suikei (Bureau of Statistics: National Wealth in 1924), 1928. (c) Naikaku-Tokeikyoku: Nippon-Teikoku-Nenkan (Bureau of Statistics: 49th Statistical Annual of Japan), 1930.</essay:p>

The increase of the average national income in Japan has, however, been surprisingly! rapid. In 1920 it was only &#165;164 as against &#165;224 in 1925&#8212;an increase of 73% in 5 years.3 As to the distribution of the national income in Japan, shown in Table II, about 70% of the total is for national family consumption, and the amount of this consumption per family is &#165;65 per month or &#165;784 per year. If each family could save only 10% or &#165;6.50 per month, avoiding luxurious consumption, it would mount up to a monthly sum of 933 million yen throughout the country, TABLE II DISTRIBUTION OF NATIONAL INCOME (1925) Total Amount Amount per Amount (000 omitted) family per capita Public fees ...........&#165; 2,033,232 &#165; 171 &#165; 34 Saving .............. 2,019,221 170 34 Consumption.......... 9,329,869 784 156 Total ............. 13,382,322 1,124 224 2.

            <essay:p>In relation to the distribution of the family consumption, 70% of the &#8226;total is spent for commodities purchased for consumption, and only 5 to 6% of the whole is devoted to other items as indicated in Table III. TABLE III DISTRIBUTION OF NATIONAL CONSUMPTION Total Amount Amount per Amount (000 omitted) family per capita Commodities purchased ......&#165;6,744,317 &#165;566 &#165;113 Transportation and communication ....... 611,740 51 10 Health ................... 561,231 47 9 Housing .................. 536&gt;454 45 9 Recreation ................ 468,147 39 8 Sundries .................. 407,980 34 7 Total ................ 9,329,869 782 156 Comparatively little reliable data for the study of the percentage of the numher of families by income groups is available, the report of the Revenue Bureau being almost the only trustworthy source.4 In Table IV, figuies over &#165;1,200 are taken directly from the estimates made by the Revenue Bureau,5 while those &quot;under &#165;1,200&quot; are obtained as explained in the notes at the foot of the table. It indicates roughly how comparatively poor the majority of Japanese are,&#8212;94.54% of the total having a family income of less than &#165;1,200 per annum and only 6% who have a family income of more than &#165;1,200 a year. Such a large percentage of the poor as 94.54, however, must be corrected roughly to&apos; 90, or a little less, because the calculation is chiefly based upon the report of the Government Revenue Bureau, and the amount of income reported by the people is generally underestimated, due to the natural tendency of human nature to evade tax burdens as much as possible. 4.

Families comprised of more than two income earning members are counted as being one family. b. The average number of members per family is 5.07 which figure was arrived at by dividing the total population in 1930 (64,447,724) by the total number of families (12,- 705,896) in the same year. The number of families &quot;under. &#165;1,200&quot; (11,564,197) in Table IV was obtained by dividing the total population in 1924 (62,122,200) by the 5.07 above mentioned and adding to it the number of persons under the heading of &quot;less than &#165;1,200&quot; in the Bureau&apos;s 55th Statistical Annual, p. 4. c. The total money income of the families, receiving less than &#165;2,200 per year, is &#165;6,973,465,000. (see Tokyo-Seiji-Kenkyujo: Seiji-Keizai-Nenkan, 1920-1930, ed. 4931, p. 298). To this amount is added &#165;30,127,200 which is the sum of the incomes of the families receiving more than &#165;1,200; but the net money income is less than &#165;1,200 on account of the reduction due to the income tax. d.

            <essay:p>The percentage distribution of the source of national income which consists of the sum of only such family incomes exceeding &#165;1,200, indicates that &quot;commerce&quot; is the most important source of national income. Next, in the following order, come &quot;Salaries, Wages, Yearly Allowances,&quot; &quot;Farm&#172; ing,&quot; etc. It stands to reason that to give a more correct picture of the source of national income in Japan as a whole, family incomes under &#165;1,200 should not be excluded. The percentages of Salaries, Wages, Yearly Allowances, Land and House Rent.and a few other items as the source of the Japanese income as a whole must be much higher than stated in Table V, but no statistics seem, at present, to he available. TABLE V PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOURCES OF NATIONAL INCOME Consisting only of those family incomes over &#165;1,200 in 1924.6 Amount Per Cent Farming .................... &#165;266,692,522 10.70 Land and House rent.......... 363,389,208 14-59 Mining ..................... 1,951,931 0.08 Livestock ................... 18,905,389 0.76 Commerce.................. 567,595,195 22.78 Industries ................... 85,771,017 3.44 Interest ..................... 56,373,065 2.26 Dividend .................... 298,729,985 IT.49 Salary, Wages, Yearly Allowances. 410,731,808 16.49 Bonus ...................... 146,921,343 5.90 Allowances.................. 60,496,403 2.43 Miscellaneous Works .......... 116,497,518 4.68 Labor...................... 3,069,048 0.12 Other income ................ 65,999,014 2.65 Forestry .................... 28,031,177 1.13 Total .................... 2,491,154,623 100.00 &#165;101.51 per month (roughly one hundred yen) was the average cost of living of 5,455 families as ascertained by the Bureau of Statistics, (1926- 1927). The most important source of such income was, of course, labor incomes which constituted 87% of the total; the balance of 13% was derived from other sources such as room-rent, property income, presents, etc. If the average family were dependent upon the wages of labor only, there would have been a deficit of &#165;4.37, or 4.49% of the total cost of living; but since &#165;14.34 was received from other sources, a surplus of &#165;9.97 was on the average available for savings. 6.

In connection with the recent reduction of the salaries of government officials, two reasons among others are worth mentioning. (1) There were in the statement of the reasons for the reduction certain weak points, such as the proposal to use the index numbers of whole&#172; sale prices for the purpose of measuring changes in the cost of living. It is very regrettable that an index number of the Cost of Living in Japan has not as yet been constructed. We have therefore no scale by which to measure properly the changes in our living cost as they from time to time occur. Under the circumstances, the index number of retail prices answers the purpose much better than that of the index number of wholesale prices. (2) I believe, however, that the strongest opposition to the proposed salary reduction arose merely from the fact that the present salaries, especially in the case of officers of the lower ranks, are wholly inadequate under existing economic conditions for officers to maintain their standard of living with their salary incomes alone. 13. 49th Statistical Annua,! of Japan, p. 283.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>CHAPTER IV FAMILY EXPENDITURES - The previous chapters have revealed what is the actual status of family incomes in Japan. How these family incomes are consumed will now be analysed. The intelligent families nowadays control their expenditure of income by the use of. family budgets which consist of the designation of &quot;the group :of commodities and services, for which prices are gathered, with their respective quantities of consumption or proportions in the total ex&#172; penditure.&quot;1 Usually, the family budgets of working-class families are made the objects of study because it is almost impossible to get a clear notion of the representative expenditures of living unless the scales and modes of living are comparatively simple. As the items of family expenditure are so numerous it will be expedient to make a selection of the more representative items. &quot;While great diversity of opinion exists as to what articles and services should be selected, the majority of authorities on the subject agree that the selections should, in some measure, represent the following five groups into which the main expenditures of an average household can be classified&#8212;(i) food, (2) housing, (3) fuel and light, (4) clothing, and (5) miscellaneous items.&quot;2 A number of analyses of family budgets have been made in different localities of Japan, but the methods of investigation are confusing. Only such studies as have been considered useful for this work have been selected, and their diverse items of expenditures have, to facilitate comparative discus&#172; sions, been classified into five &quot;major items.&quot; 1.

            <essay:p>As previously intimated the latest and most extensive study of family budgets so far made in Japan is the one carried out by the Bureau of Statistics, which investigated the expenditures of 5,455 families during 1926-1927. It will be worth while to enter more fully into the details of this investigation. The percentage distribution of expenditures for the major items in the family budgets by income groups shows that Engel&apos;s Laws of Consumption are confirmed in a general way in Japan. To be more exact: I. The law that, &quot;the greater the income the smaller the proportionate expenditure for food&quot; is confirmed. In this proposition Engel goes still further, stating &quot;The proportion expended for food is a sure index of the material prosperity of a people.&quot;3 2. That &quot;the percentage of expenditure for clothing is approximately the same, whatever the income,&quot; is confirmed. 3. That &quot;the percentage of expenditure for housing, and for fuel and light, is invariably the same, whatever the income,&quot; is not confirmed. 4. That &quot;as the income increases in amount the percentage of expendi&#172; ture for sundries becomes greater&quot; is confirmed. 3. R. C.

            <essay:p>Percentage distribution of expenditures for the major items in the family budgets by classified occupations indicates, in general, the following tendencies, as shown in Table XIII: I. The percentage of expenditure for food is least in the salaried class, and greatest in the families of farmers, while that of the wage earners occupies an intermediate position. 2. The percentage of expenditure for housing among those of the salaried class is much greater than among either the wage earners or the farmers. 3. The percentage of expenditure for fuel and light is the greatest in the farmers&apos; class and almost identical in both the salaried and the wage earners&apos; classes. 4. The percentage of expenditure for both clothing and sundries is greatest in the salaried class, and the least in that of the farmers. Table XIV which is a comparison of three different professional classes &#8212;&quot;government officials,&quot; &quot;bankers and employees of companies&quot; and &quot;teachers,&quot; reveals great differences in the percentage distribution of expendi&#172; tures in the family budgets for major items other than clothing. While &quot;bankers and employees of companies&quot; spend. \^\% for clothing, teachers spend only 12.78%. This would seem to indicate a relatively well-dressed appearance in favor of the business men! Allowing for the fact that land-owning-farmers may be presumed to have larger incomes than tenant farmers, it is found that they are no exception to the general laws of consumption described on page 20 and as shown in Table XV. In &quot;Sundries&quot; there are, as far as the amount of expenditures is con&#172; cerned, three important items; I. &quot;Society,&quot; which includes parties, presents, etc., amounting to &#165;10.29; 2. &quot;Health,&quot; amounting &#165;7.68; 3. &quot;Pleas&#172; ures,&quot; amounting to &#165;6.03. These figures appertain to the salaried class. They are much greater than those of wage earners and farmers. The fact that the farmers spend so much as &#165;7.58 fo&apos;r &quot;Society&quot; while spending only &#165;2.71 for &quot;Health&quot; and &#165;2.16 for &quot;Pleasures&quot; indicates the sturdy survival in rural districts of putting so much stress on ceremonial affairs while their brothers in the cities are year by year cutting down the expenditure on social observances.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>CHAPTER V THE CHANGES IN THE COST OF LIVING (Computation of the Index Numbers of the Cost of Living in Japan, 1915-1930) The development of index numbers for the purpose of estimating and of comparing the relative changes in the cost of living is of somewhat recent origin. At the present time index numbers are compiled more or less regularly in most civilized countries including Great Britain, France, United States, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Greece, Austria, Australia, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, etc. In all a total of about forty countries keep statistics along this line. They are constructed mostly by some department of the&quot; central government or of a municipal administration. In a few cases, they are compiled by non-official organiza&#172; tions or even by individual efforts. It is very strange that index numbers of the cost of living have never yet been compiled in Japan. The latest publication on the subject states:1 &quot;No index numbers of the cost of living, properly speaking, are compiled in Japan, although there are several series of unweighted index numbers of retail prices of daily necessities. The authors of these indexes, however, state that they are not intended to measure changes in the cost of living; hence any references to them as indexes of the cost of living, which are occasionally found, rest upon misapprehension.&quot; I was informed recently by the authorities of both the Department of Commerce and Industry, and of the Bureau of Statistics that they have little hope of obtaining a sufficient appropriation to carry out the work of constructing index numbers of the co&apos;st of living in the near future. Under the circumstances, therefore, there has been no alternative but to compile my own index numbers of the cost of living. I am fully conscious that such work is almost beyond the capacity of a single individual, but in connection with my researches in other direc&#172; tions, it is essential that I should have such figures notwithstanding the fact that they may not be quite complete. The basis of the study is the investigation of the family budgets of 1,575 salaried employees&apos;, 3,210 wage earners&apos; and 670 farmers&apos; families during one year from September, 1926 to August, 1927 by the Bureau of 1. National Industrial Conference Roard: The Cost of Living in Foreign Countries, pp. 26^&#8212;267.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Statistics.2 The number of members per family was 4.17, 4.21 and 5.83 respectively. This means that in most cases a family consists of husband, wife and two or three children. T&apos;he budgets on which the index numbers are based consists of five major items: food, fuel and light, housing, clothing, and sundries. The relative importance of the expenditures of each in the major items is as follows: Food 39.36, Fuel and Light 5.07, Housing 16.45, Clothing 11.56 and Sundries 27.56. The first major item, &quot;food,&quot; is represented by 15 items each having a different weight according to the proportional importance of the expenditure.

All these prices are taken from the index numbers of retail prices in Tokyo. For the second major item, &quot;fuel and light,&quot; the average of gas, coal, charcoal, coke, wood and electric light has been selected for computation. For the third major item, &quot;housing,&quot; the average of the index numbers of retail prices of lumber, zinc and iron plates, matting, glass-plates, and electric bulbs was selected. It is a matter for regret that that most important item, house rent, could not be included. For the fourth major item, &quot;clothing,&quot; the average of the: index num&#172; bers of retail prices of thirty articles of apparel: namely, white cotton fabric, Kanakin lining? new muslin, Kurume-kasuri.&#8482; Nasen-Kasuri,11 Yenshu- pma? bedcloth, cotton flannel, satinette, Habutaye (glossy silk), red-silk- lining, crape (silk), Kaiki (silk), Meisen (coarse silk cloth), muslin, flannel, serge, sulk cotton, thread, yarn, Haneri (tucker), shirts, stockings, Tabi (cloth socks), handkerchiefs, towels, hats, umbrellas, Geta (clogs) and shoes. In the fifth major item, &quot;sundries,&quot; we again have difficulty in getting the indexes of retail prices of those items constituting &quot;sundries&quot; and the index number of retail prices of all commodities is tentatively used. The indexes of retail prices quoted here were taken from the index numbers of retail prices in Tokyo compiled by the Bank of Japan. This is a monthly unweighted index number of retail prices which covers ioo articles in all&#8212;42 articles of food, 6 articles of fuel and light, 20 articles of clothing, and 32 miscellaneous articles. The basis for the calculation of the index number was the prices ruling in July, 1914^ In computing the index number of the cost of living in Japan, the index numbers for &apos;housing&quot; and &quot;sundries&quot; are regarded as being merely approximate, due to the impossibility of getting proper data of index numbers of house rent and retail prices of the various items or articles 8. Sweet sake and distilled spirits. 9. A kind of Calico. 10. A kind of cotton cloth with a pattern of scattered figures manufactured in Ku.rumc district. 11. A kind of cotton with a pattern of scattered figures. 12. A kind of printed mousseline. 13. For the computation of the index numbers of the cost of living in Japan from 1914 to 1925, I was obliged, due to the lack of proper data at hand, to make some changes in the selection of articles and also in the method of calculation to estimate retail pr-ice indexes- from the wholesale prices. Tbe process and the details) of this are, so complicated and tedious that they are kept in my original manuscript without publication here.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>comprised under those headings. I trust that the calculation of more complete index numbers of the cost of living will be conducted in the near future. The results of my computations are given in Table XVII and in Chart I. Since the beginning of the twentieth century the standard of living has been steadily rising, and from the time of the World War, the cost of living, especially in Japan, has made rapid advances. The index number indicates that it rose to the highest1 point in 1919, namely to 317.29, based on 100 in 1914. It then began gradually to fall, and from 1929 up to the present time the rate of falling has been much accelerated. As a result of the rapid increase in the cost of living and the advance&#172; ment of the economic society in Japan the rise in the standard of living has been very conspicuous. As stated elsewhere, it is the nature of human beings to strive hard to raise higher and higher the standard of living, and once a certain level has been attained they will again strive even harder to prevent it from dropping below that level. In comparing the index numbers of Japan and foreign countries, we find that the rising rate in Japan since 1914, was much greater than in the United States, Great Britain and several other countries. The reason for this is that, although the index numbers of the cost of living in&apos; the basic year of 1914 are naturally the same in those countrie.s, the actual cost and standard of living are quite different; but countries like Japan and Italy, on account of their cost of living having been relatively low, had much more scope for increasing to reach the level of the more advanced countries. Then again in descending, due chiefly to the recent economic depression, the people have striven much harder not to let the standard of living fall with the lower cost of living. The depression however, became still more severe during the last year or so. In October, 1930, the cost of living went down as low as 144.19&#8212;and it seems that it may even drop to the level of 1914 if the economic conditions should remain as bad as they are. The standard of living cannot, however, be lowered so much as the living cost. On the contrary, the low prices,may actually help keep up the standard to a considerable degree. Thus, the relation between the cost and the standard of living is very close, but they are not similar at all. Naturally the index number of the cost of living would not be the sole measure of the standard of living.</essay:p>

The national diet, which means the average diet of a nation, is obtained by dividing the total amount of the food destined for the consumption of the nation by the number of the total population reduced to the equivalent number of the adult population. One should remember that food consumption is a matter which differs according to different individuals, localities, climates, customs, and manners. Such being the case, the intensive method of investigation based upon the data of limited numbers often results in an erroneous conclusion with regard to the actual status of the national diet as a whole. The first step of this method is to find out the total amount of the food produced in the year to be investigated; the next, to add all imports of food; the third, to subtract all exports and also such parts of food produce which will be not used for food; and the fourth, to divide the1 sum by the number of the total population reduced to the equivalent of adults. For the sake of convenience, the regular scale of equivalent1 has been reduced to the following simplified scale: A man or woman over 15.................. 1.0 A child of 10-15 ........................ 0.8 A child of 5-10 ........................ 0.6 A child under 5 ......................... 0.4 By the adoption of these equivalents, the total population of 62,938,200^ is equivalent to 53,375,999 adults. In dividing the total net amount of the yearly produce of food by the adult , population, the quotient is the amount of the national diet per capita per annum. The national diet obtained in such a way necessarily cannot be very exact; but the results are very suggestive and valuable in the study of the national standard of living, provided we consider them in coordination with the results of the intensive studies of food consumption. 1.0 A boy of 15-16.. 0.8 A girl of 15-16 A boy of 13-14____ 0.8 A girl of 13-14. 0.7 A boy of 10-11. A girl of 10-12..... 0.6 A child of 6-9 0.4 A child under 2. . (U. S. Dept. of Agr., Farmers Bulletin, No. 142, p. 33). 2. Estimated on Oct. 1, 1929, excluding the population in Korea, Formosa and Karafuto. See The 49th Statistical Annuals of Japan.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>i. Consumption of Grains The most important grain in Japan is rice. The first use of rice is as the principal food item. Generally speaking, the principal food in Japan is exclusively composed of polished rice. Every day plain boiled rice without milk or sugar, in such a large quantity as about three bowls, on an average, is consumed at each o&apos;f the three meals.3 The second use is in the brewing of the national strong drink called sake. The third is for manifold purposes, such as the making of confectionery, starch, and barm (koji). Also seed for the next year&apos;s crop is stored away. The second and the third uses, however, are minor compared with the first. To be more exact, 1.095 koku (5.07 bushels) per annum, or 3 go (450 grams) peri diem is the average amount of rice consumption. The general belief that the Japanese principal food consists entirely of rice is true of the urban population only. The rural population use naked barley and other grains mixed and boiled with rice for their principal food. The poorer the farmer, the greater proportion of grains other than rice is used. The consumption of naked barley is 0.55 bushels per capita per annum. Ordinary barley and wheat are cultivated in Japan, but the former is chiefly used for making beer and feeding horses, and the latter for making flour. Tha following shows the amount and the cost of the grain food per capita in Japan: TABLE XIX i . CONSUMPTION OF GRAINS Kind Per capita per annum Per capita per diem Quantity Per cent Cost 4 Per cent Quantity Cost Naked barley ...... kg. 164.3 15.9 10.2 31.1 71 8 6 15 yen 28.47 0.87 0.67 1.70 90 3 2 5 gr- 450 44 28 89 sen 7.8 0.2 0.2 0.5 Total ............ 221.5 100 31.71 100 607 8.7 3. Boiled rice is served in bowls. The common bowl1 holds about a pint. 4. The cost in this table and others following, if not otherwise designated, is calculated from &quot;Retail Prices i,n Tokyo oa Feb. 15, 1931&quot; by Tokyo Sho-Ko-Kaigisho (Board of Commerce and Industry, Tokyo).</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The Japanese consume more vegetables than any other people in the world, and there are two most important kinds, namely, sweet-potatoes and daikon (garden radishes). The daily average consumption of sweet-potatoes and daikon are 131 grams and 124 grams respectively. The total of these two, amounting to 255 grams, consists of 53% of the total consumption of vegetables which is 476 grams in all. Such an enormous consumption of sweet-potatoes is due to the fact that they are used in the southern part of Japan as a part of the daily principal food and also as a kind of sweet eaten between regular meals. Garden-radishes are most extensively used as pickles which are known by the name of takuwan-zuke. They are prepared by being first dried and then pickled in a mixture of rice bran and plenty of salt. The following table shows the amount and the cost of the national consumption of vegetables: TABLE XX CONSUMPTION OF VEGETABLES Kind Per capita per annum Per capita per diem Quantity Per cent Cost Per cent Quantity Cost kg. yen gr. sen 47.3 27 2.52 39 130 0.7 Garden-radishes ... 45.8 26 0.50 8 125 0.1 15.0 9 1.40 22 41 0.4 66.3 38 2.02 31 182 0.6 Total ............ 174.4 100 6.44 100 478 1.8 3. Consumption of Legumes The soy bean (soja bean, daizu), which is very rich in proteins and fats, is the most essential legume in Japan. It is a good substitute for meat, though its nutritive value, especially in its digestibility and its vitamin contents may be inferior to meat. In comparison with its market value, however, the nutritive value is very high. The essential element of the most common dishes in daily use, such as miso, shoyu, and tofu, is the soy bean, and the numerous soy bean recipes are the favorite relishes of the people.</essay:p>

Consumption of Fruits Generally speaking, fruits are consumed by most Japanese as a refresh&#172; ment between meals, and have little value as a regular food-stuff. One exception, however, is plums (ume); the quantity of the consumption of plums is not so large as oranges and persimmons, &apos;but it is the only kind o&apos;f fruit which is consumed as regular food-stuff. This preparation is called umeboshi which is made by first drying the fruit and then pickling in plenty of salt. As a consequence of its being inexpensive and appetizing, it is consumed extensively throughout the country especially among the poorer classes of people. The umeboshi and pickled radish (takuwan-zuke) are unexcelled as appetizers, giving a relish that otherwise would he lacking in the plain boiled rice. The following table shows the consumption of fruits: 5. Small red beans only estimated; other .legumes are omitted because their quantity and cost of consumption is not so large and also, because they are omitted in the latest statistics.</essay:p>

Consumption of Animal Food In Japan, animal protein, which is the most important nutrient, is chiefly obtained from fish. More than four hundred kinds of fish are caught in Japanese waters and they are consumed by the Japanese in the same way as meat is used by the Americans. The total consumption per capita per diem is 65 grams. The price of fish is much cheaper than meat and the cost of fish consumption per capita per diem is only 2.2 sen. Besides fish, shell-fish is a popular food in Japan but it is minor in comparison with fish. The habit of eating meat is not very old in Japan. Formerly some of the Buddhists were forbidden to eat animal food of any kind and only the outcast class could enjoy animal meat. This has now changed but still the consumption of meat is limited to only a certain class of people though it is increasing steadily year by year. The quantity and the cost of the consumption of animal food is shown in the following table:</essay:p>

Consumption of Sugar and Salt In order to make the most of the nutrients contained in food, it is necessary to have good cooking with proper seasoning. Sugar and salt serve as most important elements in seasoning. Sugar is important not only as a nurient but also as an indispensable condiment. One may probably relate the consumption of sugar to the progress of civilization. A growing use of sugar seems to indicate a growing civilization. Owing to a heavy protective tariff in the interests of native sugar, the price of sugar in Japan is scarcely exceeded anywhere in civilized countries. This fact is naturally a barrier to&apos; the free use of sugar. In Japan as a whole, sugar is used most commonly for confectionery, and is not yet in much demand for cooking purposes as it ought be. In the poorer rural districts sugar is not used at all except a very little in the form of sweets,7 The consumption of salt is great partly from the fact that the habitual taste of the majority of the Japanese is inclined to salt. Such national food articles as shoyu, miso, tsukemono, which are used everywhere in great quantities for almost every meal, have plenty of salt for their essential ingredient. The sale of salt is a government monopoly in Japan and its price is not so low as it should be. The function of salt as a food is con- 6. 45 pints per capita per annum1, or 0.118 pints per diem of mil&apos;k, is included in &quot;others,&quot; and dairy products are included in the milk quantity. 7. In the small farmer&apos;s diet, it averages 0.5 to 1 pound per capital der diem. See Morimoto: Standard of Living in Japan, p. 31.</essay:p>

Until a certain limit is reached, as human taste advances, it craves more and more for sugar in cooking. The consumption of sugar and salt is shown in the following table: TABLE XXIV CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR AND SALT Per capita per annum Per capita per diem &apos; Quantity Per cent Cost Per cent Quantity Cost Sugar .................. kg. 15.6 16.2 49 51 yen 5.46 1.59 77 23 gr. 43 44 sen 1 5 Salt ..................... 0 4 Total ............ 31.8 100 7.05 100 87 1 9 7. Consumption of Liquor, Tea, and Tobacco Liquor, tea, and tobacco are not strictly food articles, yet they have a close relation to food consumption. They have little value as nutrients; at best they serve only as stimulants. Their cost is, however, dispropor&#172; tionately high and they should be considered as belonging to the class of luxurious consumption. Sake which may be called the national drink of Japan, is brewed from rice and contains 15 or 16% of alcohol. Besides the native drinks, we have the imported liquors such as whiskey and cham&#172; pagne. The consumption of these foreign liquors is not so important because their use is limited to a few of the richer classes. The consumption of liquor together with that of tobacco and tea is shown in the following table:</essay:p>

            <essay:p>CHAPTER VII THE TREND OF CHANGES IN THE NATIONAL DIET By the use of the same method of investigation, I have been keeping up the study of the national diet so far in five different years, namely, 1916, 1918, 1921, 1925, and 1929. In comparing these studies, it is interesting to discover that some changes with a certain regularity are occurring from time ta time in the consumption of food materials in Japan at large. To state some of the striking features: in grains, there is a tendency toward a gradual decrease of consumption in the grains other than rice. This is because the standard of living of the rural population has recently risen to a higher level and now they use more rice and less other grains as their principal food. In vegetables, we notice the great decrease of sweet-potato consump&#172; tion. This also may be due to the fact that those people in the southern part of Japan who used to eat sweet-potatoes as their principal food are now consuming more rice as do their brothers in the urban districts. There is a noteworthy increase of consumption in all kinds of fruits. Then, a steady and gradual increase of consumption in meat and milk is conspicuous. The consumption of sugar has been invariable since 1918, but the use of salt has greatly increased. Sake consumption increased rapidly up to 1921 and then greatly dropped. Beer, though the amount of consumption is very little compared to that of sake, shows a gradual increase in its use. In the consumption of tobacco, the use of cigarettes is increasing and kizami (chopped) has decreased. The consumption of tea has been the same at all periods, probably always approximating the point of saturation from the olden time up to this date. The details of the changes in the national diet are shown in the follow&#172; ing tables:</essay:p>

            <essay:p>CHAPTER VIII FOOD FOR THE EFFICIENCY STANDARD OF LIVING Rational food consumption should be controlled by the following factors: (i) Amount of Nutrients, (2) Amount of heat generation, (3) Absorption and digestibility, and (4) Market price of food. Besides the adequate vitamin contents, protein, fat and carbohydrate are the three forms of nutrients which should be contained in food. The most valuable form of these three from the standpoint of economy and physiology is protein, because it is the most expensive nutrient in price and its function especially that of animal protein, is more essential than other nutrients. There are differences of opinion as to the amount of nutrients needed pei&apos; capita per diem. According to the most commonly recognized authorities, such as Voit, Atwater, Playfair, etc., we may set a standard of daily dietaries for an average Japanese at moderate work as follows: Protein, 96 grams; fats, 45 grams; carbohydrates, 406 grams.1 These figures were formerly modified in consideration of the Japanese dietary habit of not using so much animal food as the Westerners, and the Bureau of Hygiene of the Japanese Government arranged the standard in 1886 as follows: Protein, 96 grams; fat, 20 grams; and carbohydrates, 450 grams.2 The dietary habits of the Japanese, however, have greatly changed since that time and nowadays at least the younger population craves for meals containing twice as much of fats as what is supposed to be adequate according to the old standard suggested by the Bureau of Hygiene. The Standard Diets by the Bureau of Hygiene per capita per diem are as follows: The First Example Rice ............... Beef ............... Cucumber or Melon. . . White Potatoes....... Japanese onion ....... Miso............... Milk............... 752 grams 225 &quot; 56 &quot; / Protein........ 95.7 grams 75 &quot; &gt; Fats .......... 28.O 75 &quot; [ Carbohydrates . . 454.3 19 &quot;. 0.32 pint 1. See Morimoto: Standard of Living, p. 22. 2. Dept. of interior Affairs: Articles of Food First Example of the Standard Diet.</essay:p>

II Gomanoyu (oil)........ 4 The amount of heat generation is expressed by the number of calories. While one gram of either protein or carbohydrate produces 4.1 calories, fat generates as much as 9.3 calories. The amount of calories required by the average Japanese, body-weight being 52 kilograms, is about 2,400 calories. This figure includes about 200 calories for food waste and about 140 calories for the heat needed for digestion and absorption. Unless the nutrients are easily digested and absorbed, the heat requirement will be greater. For this reason especially, though vegetable protein is much cheaper in price than animal protein, the former is as a nutrient inferior to the latter on account of the fact that it is less digestible and will not absorb easily. The distribution of cost among the principal classes of food materials in Japan and America is shown in the following table: TABLE XXVIII PROPORTION OF TOTAL COST DEVOTED TO DIFFERENT CLASSES OF FOODS Milk&amp; Cream Meats &amp; other pro&#172; tein foods Fats Sugar Staples Fruits &amp; vegetable 0.31 11.20 16.10 25-30 15.30 26.00 28.00 17-25 11.60 10.00 10-12 6.50 3.60 5.20 about 3 55.29 15.70 15.00 12-15 22.54 31.10 24.80 15-18 3.

The cost of the standard diet is 49.2 sen. The average cost of these four kinds of diets is 45.4 sen and this amount may be considered as the ordinary minimum cost of the diet per capita per diem for the maintenance of an efficiency standard of living in Tokyo. The diet prepared in the European style is generally much more expen&#172; sive because some of the food articles are not very common in ordinary markets, and their prices are naturally higher compared to the common materials containing similar nutrients and used by the majority of the Japanese. Table XXXIII will show that if the diet which is used as a standard diet for an efficiency standard of living in New York City, were to be served in Tokyo, it would become a very expensive diet.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>CHAPTER IX IMPROVEMENT OF FOOD CONSUMPTION IN JAPAN To maintain an efficiency standard of living, the right use of food is fundamentally necessary. Recent progress in the scientific study of nutrition and cookery, however, has been too rapid to keep pace with the dietary habits of the great mass of the poor people. Naturally, there are a number of defects in the Japanese habits of food consumption and the following may be suggested for their improvement: i. Increase in the consumption of animal protein AND VITAMIN As far as the amount of calories is concerned, the Japanese diet is not insufficient, but the quality of the source from which the calories generate is not quite adequate. First of, all, there is a lack of animal protein and vitamins. Fishes which are abundant in supply and comparatively low in price should be consumed in larger quantities by the rural population. Animal protein is of course much more expensive, but when realizing the happy result of better health and hence greater efficiency of labor which it brings, consuming meat in generous quantities will be profitable. The urgent need for the improvement of the Japanese dietary habit is to increase the consump&#172; tion of meat, milk and dairy products which are the essential source of vitamins. For this purpose, a much lower price is necessary in order that the great mass of people may be accommodated. 2. Increase in the consumption of leguminous food; The nutritive value of plant-protein is not so large when compared to that of animal protein, but their prices, being rather low, are within reach of the purchasing power of the average person. By the greater use of legumes, the deficiency of animal protein may be supplemented to a certain degree. 3. A Less Quantity of Rice and a Greater Variety of Vegetables and Other Subordinate Food The common diet among the mass of the poor people in Japan as a whole consists of boiled rice, soya-bean soup (Misojiru), and pickled garden radishes. Both soy-bean and the pickled radish act as good appetizers on the</essay:p>

            <essay:p>plain boiled rice. Such simple food is very cheap in cost, but this advantage is apt to be offset by the danger of malnutrition due to the enormous use of rice as a main food. The amount of the daily consumption of rice must be lessened by using a more varied supply of other kinds of grains and vegetables, especially such things as wheat, corn, and potatoes. The disadvantage of a diet which is composed of too much rice and too little subordinate food is twofold: first, it is hard to get nutrients in sufficient quantity; second, when a varied diet is obtainable, the intensity of the appetite is so great as to cause one to eat more than is physiologically needed. In order that food may havoi its proper variety, too much salt should not be used in its preparation. Vitamins and other nutrients can be properly and advantageously absorbed only when food of proper variety is consumed. 4. Less use of refreshments between meals The under-consumption of regular meals and the over-consumption of refreshments between meals have cyclical relations to each other. Japanese custom compels the excessive use of tea, sweets, fruits, etc. at irregular times. For example, it is common etiquette to serve tea and sweets to visitors, no matter what the purpose or the time of the call may be. As may be expected, the use of refreshments naturally weakens the appetite for regular meals, which in turn promotes the desire for refreshments. Such cyclical relations cause malnutrition an the long run. It is mo&apos;re enjoyable, as well as more economical, to concentrate the pleasing sensations which come from food consumption. In the case of children and certain persons for whom some supplementary food is necessary, the additional meals should be provided at regular intervals. 5. Improvement of the kitchen A more careful attention should be paid to the construction of the kitchen. The customary idea that the &quot;guest room&quot; is the most important is erroneous. The kitchen and living rooms which are in constant use must be given preeminence in location and construction. Then primitive stoves and utensils in common use must be improved to save the waste of time and labor.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>CHAPTER X CLOTHING FOR THE EFFICIENCY STANDARD OF LIVING The study of clothing from the view of economic consumption is a subject exceedingly complicated because it changes greatly according to the taste, income, fashions, climate, social classes, etc. Naturally, there ar&quot; as yet only a few publications which are available for the study of clothing in Japan. My work on this line of study dealing with clothing is based on the data of 1914&#8212;15.1 Due to the scarcity of more recent investigations and also to the fact that on the whole the use of clothing and its expenditure has not changed much since that time, I herewith use the same data, only with changes in price, to ascertain the proper clothing adequate for the efficiency standard of living in the large cities of Japan. The figures are the average of seven hundred and forty-three schedules, and those enumerated here are the average for Tokyo, Nagoya, and Kyoto. TABLE XXXIV FAMILY EXPENDITURE FOR CLOTHING OF THE INCOME GROUP, &#165;960-&#165;1679 IN THE LARGE CITIES2 Father: Japanese clothing European clothing Mother ____...... Boy (average age, 7) Girl (average age, 8) Total ........ Value of Clothing (yen) Expenditure per annum (yen) 171.20 41.25 151.24 52.90 33248 94.15 282.71 59.19 47-36 119.11 781.66 23.40 38.84 215.58 1. For details, see- Morimoto: &quot;Standard of Living in Japan,&quot; pp. 71&#8212;114. 2. The prices in 1930 are used in these estimations. The &quot;large cities&quot; consist of Tokyo, Nagoya and Kobe. 3. Due to the fact that clothing is generally worn for a much longer period than stated in the column under &quot;Duration&quot; in the following pages, the real expenditure per year would be about 20% less.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Cost per annum Dressmaking .......................... 12.55 Needles, threads ....................... 1.75 Other articles ......................... 16.65 Total ........................... ill .40 Each adult ........................... 37.13 Each child ........................... 12.38 The leading features of the expenditure for clothing in the Japanese cities are as follows: (1) The fabric most used is cotton; the consumption of cotton fabrics per capita per annum is 31 yards, entailing an expenditure of about three yen. (2) The materials next in importance are silk fabrics and silk mixtures. The consumption per capita per annum is 6 yards, an expense of three yen. (3) Woolen fabrics and woolen mixtures are used only to a small extent; their consumption per capita per annum is 1.2 yards, a value of eighty-eight sen. The use of these fabrics is generally limited to the urban population. (4) The expenditure for clothing is greater in the large cities than in the small ones. (5) The percentage of expenditure for clothing decreases with the increase of income. (6) In the apportionment of expenditure for clothing among the different members of the family, the father uses 54%, the mother 38%, the girl 18%, and the boy 12%. (7) The use of European clothing is limited chiefly to the father and the children. The use of European clothing results as whole in a greater expenditure for clothing on the father&apos;s part, but for the children it frequently means some saving in cost over their native clothing. (8) The Japanese dress varies greatly in style, form and material. At least three different kinds of both overcoats and garments (padded, medium weight, and light weight) must be provided according to the change of the seasons. (9) The costly Japanese costume can be worn for a comparatively long time. Generally, silk costumes which are worn by the majority of people are not so durable, but since they are worn on only a few special occasions, probably not mo&apos;re than one or two dozen times a year among people of the middle classes, they may last over a period of ten years or more. For this reason, the yearly expenditure for clothing is not so heavy in spite of its high price.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>CHAPTER XI IMPROVEMENT OF CLOTHING Recently men and children have come) to use European costume to a great extent. European clothing is necessarily worn as the street and work&#172; ing dress, and the Japanese, as the house and ceremonial dress. It would be a convenient custom to adopt both the Japanese and European dress if it v/ere not necessary to: consider the expense. The. expense of two kinds of clothing, howver, is so&apos;mewhat of a waste and can hardly be justified in an efficiency standard of living. For the improvement of clothing, the use of only one set, either European or Japanese, is fundamentally necessary. As for (women&apos;s apparel, however, the use of the European costume is limited to a very small number. In comparing European and Japanese clothing, the following points should be observed: (i) The Japanese dress is not serviceable for active work. (2) The making of the Japanese dress requires a greater expenditure of time] and labor than that of the European garment. (3) The main materials used for the Japanese dress^&#8212;namely, silk and cotton&#8212;are not so satisfactory as wool, which is the main material used for the European dress. On the other hand,, the Japanese costume has the following points which surpass the European: (1) The European dress fits too tightly and is not so comfortable as tha Japanese dress, especially for those who are unaccustomed to the European kind. (2) Making men&apos;s European clothes at home is generally impracti&#172; cable. (3) Mending European clothes is very difficult, while the Japanese dress ,is very easily mended and is co&apos;mmonly remade. Taking all these factors into consideration, there is a tendency for the European costume1 to possibly become an integral part of the native dress in Japan, at least for men and children. &apos; Asj for women, however, the use of European clothes is almo&apos;st insignificant. The reasons why Japanese women do not adopt the European clothes may be enumerated as follows: (1) Japanese women, generally speaking, have! comparatively short legs in proportion to&apos; the rest; of the body, and on them, the Japanese dress (2) In the moral training of Japanese women even at present, great</essay:p>

            <essay:p>stress is placed on the virtues of gentleness and meekness even sacrificing modern conveniences. (3) The Japanese women as a whole are not required to enter such an active life as men, and the inconveniency in wearing Japanese costume is not so great as with men. (4) For the sake of economy, women keep to the use of one set of Japanese clothing only. The fashions o&apos;f the European dress change much oftener and it would be quite expensive to follow those ever-changing fashions. Taking the foregoing points into consideration, the Simplification and the Economy of Clothing are of the first importance for improvement. Japanese custom tends to lavishness and waste in expenditure for clothing. Too many different kinds of suits are required to appear properly on different occasions. First, three different kinds of garment in weight&#8212;&quot;wataire,&quot; &quot;awase,&quot; and &quot;hitoye&quot;&#8212;in both kimono (coat) and haori (overcoat)&#8212; are used for the different seasons. Then the garments for each season must include an everyday dress, a visiting dress, and a ceremonial dress. The ceremonial dress and the visiting dress are very costly but their use is greatly limited. They are simply hoarded and are often used as little as once or twice a year. Under the circumstances, a lavish custom, such as to make women feel it is necessary to change her visiting dress at each social call in order to display her large store of clothing, is still prevailing :n ladies&apos; society. In the improvement of women&apos;s clothing, however, we must not slight the importance of grace and beauty in dress. Since the idea of ornament is one of the important objects of clothing, simplification or practicability should not impair graceful and beautiful lines. At the same time, freedom of movement and reasonable durability of material should be maintained in the Japanese costume. So far the so-called improved garment which has been proposed from time to time has been rather a failure. The chief reason has been that it has not combined aesthetic lines with its practical and economical nature. It is therefore desirable that specialists should design improved garments well adapted to Japanese conditions in order to maintain an efficient standard of life. Until then, it is advisable that the apparel of men and chldren should be principally European, and that of the women, Japanese, with such improvements as (1) more use of the &quot;hakama&quot; which is a kind of skirt to put over the kimono, (2) simplification of the Bash (&quot;obi&quot;), (3) the use of improved clogs or sandals, (4) more machine work instead of hand work in the process of making garments.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>CHAPTER XII HOUSING FOR THE EFFICIENCY STANDARD OF LIVING AND ITS IMPROVEMENT During the last decade or two, a number of new style houses have been built and housing conditions seem to have made a great change. On the whole, however, such changes in buildings have occurred only in very limited localities, mostly in the large cities. The housing conditions in Japan which I published in &quot;The Standard of Living in Japan&quot; will not be very far from the present housing conditions in the. rural districts. Out of the 863 schedules which were used in my former study1 in the survey for both clothing and housing in the cities, 680 have been used for this .study. Some of the leading facts as to housing conditions for the middle class, which is supposed to maintain the efficiency standard of living in the large cities, are as follows: A typical family of the income,) group of 960&#8212;1679 yen lives in a house of 1,504 square feet in the small cities and of 1,058 square feet in the large cities. The numher of rooms is about seven in both cases. The size of rooms is 115 square feet in the small cities and 90J square feet in the large cities. The 1930 rate of house rent is &#165;13.46 in the small cities and &#165;23.39 *n tne large &apos;cities. This fact means that about 20%&gt; of the fanrly income is spent for rent in the large cities. The principles of expenditure for housing which are deduced as a result of the investigation are as follows: (1) The expenditure for housing in the family budget increases with the severity of the climate. (2) The expenditure for food, clothing, and housing stand in cor&#172; relation in the family budget. (3) The expenditure for housing tends to increase rapidly as the family income increases. (4) The expenditure for housing in the family budget is much greater in the city than in the country; also, the larger the city, the greater the expenditure. (5) The rate of rent per month paid by poor families is greater than that by families of the middle and high classes. For the maintenance of the efficiency standard of living, the following conditions must be provided so&apos; that the proper functions of a house may be fulfilled: 1.

            <essay:p>(i) The house should be strong and large enough to accommodate the family comfortably and efficiently. (2) The house should have ample hygienic facilities such as good water supply, plenty of sunlight, good ventilation, sanitary disposal of waste materials, etc. (3) The building plan should be adapted to meet the needs of eco&#172; nomic and social life. .,(4) The house should be located in a place both healthful and convenient. Just as there are minimum standards for food and clothing, so, also must there be a lower limit in the use of housing. Of course, that limit is very hard to ascertain and the only fundamental way to determine it is to work with the results of physiological experiments on the space necessary for human living. It is calculated that a man inspires from 16 to 18 cubic feet of air in an hour, and at the same time expires from 0.5 to 0.7 cubic feet of carbonic acid gas. Air which contains more than six ten-thousandths of carbonic acid gas is injurious to life. Based upon these figures, the minimum space which is physiologically necessary for one man has been estimated at 600 cubic feet for an ordinary living room, 1,000 cubic feet for dormitories or other buildings designed for group life, and 1,300 cubic feet for hospitals or other buildings where fresh air is especially needed. The rooms most commonly used in Japan are the six-mat room, which is 9 by 12 feet, or 108 square feet, and the eight-mat room, which is 12 by 12 feet, or 144 square feet. The usual height of the ceiling from the floor is 8^2 feet. Thus a six-mat room, which has a spatial area of 918 cubic feet, is large enough for one and a half adult persons, and an eight- mat room, which contains 1214 cubic feet, is large enough for two grown&#172; ups. This means that 72 square feet of floor space are necessary for one person&apos;s sleeping place. In the ordinary Japanese house, the room area is about fifty per cent of the whole house area. According to this calculation, the necessary house area for an adult is 144 square feet and for a family of four adult members, 576 square feet. For the improvement of Japanese housing, the following suggestions may be made: (1) The united type, not the mixed one of Japanese and European types of building, should be adopted. Instead of putting European and Japanese types together side by side without much consideration of cost and harmony of architecture, the harmonious union of the Japanese and the European should be the main object of the improvement. (2) The European type of building, with much of Japanese art</essay:p>

The Japanese type of building, which has grown out of the influence of ancient Korean, Indian, and Persian architectures, has a number of attractive features. This type, however, has certain points not suitable for modern life which is so oppressed by economic considerations. (3) It is desirable to abolish the use of tatami (straw-matting) because it is both unsanitary and uneconomical. Not only is it difficult to clean, but a change of the surface covering is necessary almost every year. (4) The building&apos; plans should be so improved as to avoid a showy appearance without much practicability or utility. For example, thuogh the sitting room and kitchen are used constantly, they occupy a place much inferior to that of the parlor or the front vestibule, which are very little used. (5) The cooperative way of living should be encouraged. If rightly managed, the central heating system, cooperative kitchens and diniing rooms, such as in apartments and tenement houses, and the cooperative use of the yard, garden, bath, washing place, entrance, halls, corridors, and so on, would be beneficial for the maintenance of the efficiency standard of living for those having comparatively small family incomes,</essay:p>

            <essay:p>CHAPTER XIII ESTIMATION OF THE COST OF LIVING FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF AN EFFICIENCY STANDARD OF LIVING IN JAPAN Something in the nature of a summary of the cost of living,- drawing together some of the foregoing &apos;factors, may properly be treated in these concluding pages. But the cost of living as previously stated, is condi&#172; tioned by many different elements, and the computation of the expenditure cannot be done with a high degree of exactness unless a sufficient number of proper records can be obtained for similarly situated families. To obtain such records, however, is beyond the reach of my ability and these, studies only suggest some of the general ideas of the standard in the terms of family expenditure or income. Now then, what amount of family income should be necessary for the maintenance of an efficiency standard o&apos;f living in Japan? For the computation of such cost, it is advantageous to adopt a method of estimation in deducing the total cost of living from the cost of food, clothing, and housing. According to Engel&apos;s Law of Consumption as stated before, the expenditure for food, does not grow in proportion to the total expendi&#172; ture. &quot;This decrease in the proportion of the income given to food went entirely to swell the expenditures on sundries.&quot;1 In order to enjoy there&#172; fore a fair amo&apos;unt of &quot;sundries&quot; which includes all expenditures for educa&#172; tion, recreation, society, taxes, etc., the expenditure for food consumption must not exceed a certain limit. Now, the studies described in Chapter* VIII, show that the cost of the food consumption is 45.4 sen per capita per diem, o&apos;r &#165;1.50 per family of 3.3 units. On this basis, a family consisting of two grown-ups and three children, must spend about &#165;45 per month for food. By the con&#172; sideration of the percentage distribution o&apos;f family expenditures as already stated, 35 % of the total cost of living is about the average of food expenditure for families sustaining the efficiency standard. Then, approximately, &#165;130 will be the amount of family income with which an efficiency standard of living may be maintained in Tokyo. In the same way, the average clothing expenditure of a normal family is &#165;18 per month corresponding to 14% of the total cost of living&apos;; and 1.

            <essay:p>the housing expenditure, &#165;20, or 16%. On the basis of these percentages the total cost will amount to&apos; &#165;130 and &#165;125&apos; respectively. The deduction of the total cost of living from other items will bring about the same result. Such being the case, the conclusion is that a family income of &#165;130 per month is the minimum amount required for the maintenance of an efficiency standard o&apos;f living in the large cities. The amount and percentage distribution of the family expenditure may then be summarized as follows: TABLE XL MINIMUM FAMILY EXPENDITURE AND ITS DISTRIBUTION AS REQUIRED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF AN EFFICIENCY STANDARD OF LIVING (Per family per month in 1931) Cost (yen) per cent Food ...................... 45.50 35 Clothing ................... 18.20 14 Housing ................... 22.10 17 Sundries ................... 44.20 34 Total................ 130.000 100 As a whole, a normal family consisting of parents and three children will not be able to maintain the efficiency standard of living with a monthly income o&apos;f less than &#165;130 in 1931 in the city of Tokyo. The presumable range of these incomes may be set forth as &#165;130&#8212;200 per month, or &#165;1,500&#8212;2,400 per year. Ordinarily, the standard of living falls into three broad divisions: that of the poor, of the middle class, and; of the rich. Although these teims are used without much scientific precisio&apos;n, customary usage will justfy the following interpretation of the terms. The poor is the term used in a broad sense for all those who are in such an economic insufficiency as not to be able to satisfy their wants for necessity and decency. Professor Hollander defines it in the narrowed sense as: &quot;midway between the modestly circum&#172; stanced and the outright dependent are&apos; the poor in the sense of the inade&#172; quately fed, clad, and sheltered.&quot;2 The middle class is the term including all those families whose income, if expended in the most economical ways, allows them to enjoy the efficiency 2.

            <essay:p>THE STANDARD OF LIVING AMONG CHINESE WORKERS By E. K. Tao I An extraordinary situation in the world of nations and peoples has been created by the geniuses of invention, discovery and organiza&#172; tion in the modern age. The remarkable progress in the means of communication and the unprecedented development of mechanical productive processes, at least in some quarters of the globe, during the last one hundred and fifty years have undoubtedly, for good or ill, drawn the nations much closer day by day and made them more and more interdependent as never before. In spite of national boundaries, high tariff walls, bounties, in short, all the measures that aim at pro&#172; moting national self-sufficiency on the one hand and lessening the mutuality of national interests on the other, it is evident that no nation can at present escape from this increasing contact and inter&#172; dependence of nations. Certain goods must go from one country and enter into another while misfortunes that visit one nation must sooner or later have repercussions on the others. Relationships of such an international character are innumerable and extremely intri&#172; cate and it seems that there is hardly any social or economic problem of the present day that can not be traced to its international aspects. Viewed in this light, it would not be astonishing to find, to take one instance, that the hair net industry of Chefoo, on which the livelihood of thousands of workers depended, was ruined for no other reason than a change of fashion in the distant lands in Europe and America, the adoption of the bobbed hair by women. In view of what has been said, it seems evidently impossible under the present world conditions for the rest of the world to ignore alto-</essay:p>

            <essay:p>gether the living conditions of the Chinese who constitute at least one- fifth, or according to some one quarter, of the population of the globe. How Chinese live is not only China&apos;s own affair but will have im&#172; portant consequences upon every other nation on the earth that can not be ignored. If it appears that the prevailing standard of living of modern nations is considerably higher than that among the masses of China, it is expected that they can not be contented to remain so for long and must sooner or later attempt by every possible means to approximate the prevailing living level. Nor can she enjoy a life of comfort and plenty in the midst of universal poverty without being interfered with, if the contrary is the case. This, let it be remarked, is not merely a matter of the standard of living, as it would ramify itself and become inextricably involved with a host of significant economic problems, such as international trade, immigration, inter&#172; national finance and production. Hence some consideration of the standard of living of the Chinese may now be attempted. What follows is intended as a general survey of its present conditions. Before we proceed, it seems desirable to make a few terms clear. When we study the living conditions of a class or a people, it is customary to ascertain the cost of living or living expenses of an average family. Now the cost of living may mean either of the two things. It may be the actual cost, as collected from a number of families, which represents the average expenses an average family expends in a period of time in order to live, or it may be some standard cost as measured by a purely hypothetical concept of needs and the money cost of supplying them. In fact the two are quite distinct, though they are often used interchangeably with great confusion. To be precise, they should be respectively called the cost of living and the standard of living. In other words, the former refers to conditions as they are, while the latter is to ascertain the conditions as they should be. It should be pointed out once for all that all inquiries into living conditions in</essay:p>

            <essay:p>China belong to the first category,. That is to say, they are all represen&#172; tations of a &quot;standard of living&quot;, not in any theoretical sense or in the form of an ideal that should be striven to attain but as the con&#172; ditions prevailing for a given time, place and class of labourers. The costs of living revealed by the inquiries may be taken as &quot;standards&quot; in the sense of prevailing conditions. It may also be pointed out that even the standard of living con&#172; ceived as a theoretical standard of requirements may be of various kinds. Sometimes it refers to a minimum standard, that is, for the bare maintenance of physical efficiency, below which no family or individual can survive in a humanly possible way, while at other times it means a decent or desirable standard which is found necessary to maintain a healthy and comfortable life. Here again the two standards are not necessarily identical and yet they are very often used without distinction. According to the traditional division of the subject matter of economics, the question of the standard of living falls under that part of the science known as consumption. The usual procedure of study&#172; ing the question is to estimate the quantities of staple commodities consumed by the population of the nation, and then ascertain from their quantity or value the per capita consumption. In the absence of complete production and consumption statistics and, what is more im&#172; portant, population census in this country, it has been deemed inadvis&#172; able to approach the study by this method. Moreover, per capita con&#172; sumption obtained by this method does not in any way show the actual standard of living, because of the variance of living conditions in dfferent social classes. Per capita consumption tells us practically nothing about the standard of living of a people. A more reliable wvv of ascertaining the standard of living of a people appears to be a budgetary inquiry of a nation-wide scope in&#172; cluding a sufficient number of families whose economic conditions</essay:p>

            <essay:p>are more or less similar. Such a nation-wide inquiry of family budgets has not yet been attempted in this country, because the wide extent extent of the territory and the heterogeneous character of the living conditions in it, not to say the cost and difficulty involved in carrying it out, would constitute formidable obstacles to such an undertaking, at least for the present. In such an inquiry, if it is to be conducted, the further question may be raised as to the particular class of people for whom the standard of living is to be investigated. Seeing that living conditions often differ enormously among various social classes, it is evidently important to limit the study to only one or two classes deserving particular attention. As it is the labouring class that con&#172; stitutes the producers of goods and services supplying the needs of the nation and it is they that are usually inadequately paid and have a low living standard, what is important will therefore be essentially some consderation of the living conditions of the working classes of the country. Although the working class budgetary inquiry of a nation-wide scope has yet to be made in China, it is nevertheless satisfactory to note for the present that no less than 82 enquiries into the cost or standard of living among Chinese labourers and peasants, each, it is true, be&#172; ing of a local character, have been conducted since 1917 by various persons or institutions. It goes without saying that these inquiries differ from one another in many important respects; not only they were conducted at different times, but the scope, the period of time covered, methods of investigation, computation and analysis and even the use of terms often vary among them. While only a few inquiries were conducted with the painstaking method of keeping daily ac&#172; counts for the families under investigation, a method which, if care&#172; fully used, would, it may be urged, yield accurate and very reliable results, yet many were simplv arbitrary estimates for a very limited number of households which may have some practical value but are decidedly inadequate for any accurate measurement of the standard of living. It will thus be seen that the value of the inquiries varies</essay:p>

            <essay:p>greatly. Nevertheless it may be maintained that the data these in&#172; quiries yielded may at least supply us some notion of the living standard of some section of the working population of the country. II A review of the cost of living inquiries so far conducted in this country may now engage our attention. As tabulated in the Appendix they may appropriately be grouped as urban families, 48, rural urban families, 5, rural families 16 and individuals, 13. Some important results of the first three groups will be summarily presented in the subsequently pages, while the last group, given merely as reference, will not be dealt with in this paper. First of all, it is of interest to know the average income together with the average cost of living of the working households that were covered by the inquiries. It is necessary to know the average family earnings or income because they are the means whereby the standard of living of the members, of a family is maintained or the need of necessaries to which they are accustomed is supplied; and it is the earnings that transform themselves to family expenditure. It has been found that the family earnings in 43 (or about 74 per cent) of the 58 inquiries in which the family earnings were ascertained (or 62 per cent of the total inquiries) fell in the range of $100 and $400. And the cost of living in 53 (or about 80 per cent) of the 66 inquiries in which living expenses were ascertained (or 77 per cent of the total of inquiries) fell in the same range; in fact one third of the inquiries confined themselves to families with an annual living expenditure of between two to three hundred dollars. If we leave aside the extreme cases, whose average annual income and expenses are exceedingly low or high, it may be presumed that for the majority of the working families tne average annual income and living expenses amount to from $100 to 400 each.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>It should be remarked that living expenses just referred to can hardly be used to judge the standard of living, as the purchasing power of money changes with time and space. They are given here because in the mind of the ordinary person it is the money income and money expenses that are used for comparing living conditions. In terms of the curren y of the United States of America and Great Britain at the present rate of exchange, it is noteworthy, the range of the average annual income and the average annual expenditure of Chinese working families under investigation is incredibly low, being between G.$25 and C$100 or between &#163;5 and &#163;20. In this connection it should be observed that a family with an annual income and an annual expenditure of from $100 to $400 in China by no means represents the poorest class, as it still has a narrowly sufficient income to cover its living expenses. There is no doubt that, as is to be shown later, the quality of its living leaves very much to be desired, and compares extremely unfavourably with that of the family of a similar occupation or standing in other countries. But it should be borne in mind that the earnings are in general low throughout all classes in China and to earn a bare livilihood is all the great majority of her population can do. As there must be millions of families which are unable to earn even a bare livelihood, the $100-$400 class may therefore rightly claim to rise above the line of poverty and belong to the low income group of the country. Regarding the geographical distribution of the inquiries, it appears that while many of them were concentrated in Peipmg and its environs and in Shanghai&#8212;the former claimed 18 and the latter 12, both amounting to more than two-fifths of the total number of inquiries&#8212;those devoted to other parts of the country were unhappily few in comparison. On the whole it may be said that while the towns and country districts lying along or within a reasonable distance to the sea board have been fairly well covered by the inquiries, local&#172; ities in the interior were relatively very much neglected.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>It is evident that tremendous and important local differences must Occur in the standard of living in various parts of China. On the one hand climates vary in different latitudes while on the other hand economic resources, such as soil fertility and mineral production to&#172; gether with transportation facilities are very unequally distributed in the country. It is also well-known that the town and the country as a rule offer quite distinct living conditions. Incomplete as the in&#172; quiries are as a nation-wide survey, nevertheless a cursory examina&#172; tion of them reveals that on the whole there are decidedly local dif&#172; ferences of a prominent kind in the standard of living. Now if we take a higher percentage for food expenses together with a lower per&#172; centage for miscellaneous expenses in the total family expenditure as showing a higher standard of living, as in fact it is, then the localities covered by the 48 inquiries into the cost of living of the town labourers may accordingly be roughly divided into three groups, representing three regions, namely, the north, the central and the south. It is found that the food percentage is generally lower in the south than in the north and the central, for which it is about the same, while the mis&#172; cellaneous percentage is much lower in the north than in the south and the central which approximate each other. On the whole one may conclude that a gradation of the standard of living seems to ap&#172; pear in China in the order of the north, the central and the south. It may be remarked here that as some of the inquiries in the northern region referred to unskilled labourers, and those for the central and south regions were mainly for factory workers, it is inevitable that the results of the former are unfavourable in comparison. Nevertheless it may be contended that the conclusion we have drawn appears to be coincident with and in fact is supported by our usual experiences. There is no gainsaying that on the average the general standard of living is inferior in the north to that in the south in China. And the same concluson holds true also for the village families. A comparison of the standard of living among the farmers and peasants in different regions is illustrated by a series of surveys made</essay:p>

            <essay:p>by Buck of Nanking University. It is shown that the average of the food percentage for eight surveys in districts in the northern region (namely, in northern Anhwei, Hopei, Honan, and Shansi) which is 62.1 per cent is distinctly higher than the same for five surveys in the central and southern regions (namely, southern Anhwei, Fukien and Kiangsu) which is 53.8 pr cent. The average of the miscel&#172; laneous expenses is 13.6 per cent for th former and 20.3 per cent for the latter, which also shows the superiority of the standard of living among the farming population in the south. When the vocational distribution of the workers included in the various inquiries is considered, it is found that they are heterogeneous in character and may be grouped in a broad way under the following classes: factory workers, handicraft and skilled workers, rickshamen, servants, postmen, and peasants and farmers. It is evident that the selection of the families in various inquiries was not made on a uniform plan and the classification of their vocations was far from being consistent with one another. Consequently no valid generalization can be made with regard to the relation between the vocation and the living conditions of various families. Nevertheless, it is possible for us to find from an examination of the data presented in the appendix that, generally speaking, factory and skilled workers are superior to handicraft workers and coolies, and farmers are superior to agricultural labourers in the cost of living. As the cost of living is not necessarily the same thing as the standard of living, a higher amount in the family expenditure does not therefore always. mean a higher living level. It is important to examine the distribution of the living expenditure among the working families as disclosed by the various studies. The percentages of the living expenses of the 69 inquiries, classified in the usual manner under the five principal groups of food, clothing, house rent, light and heat and miscellaneous, are shown</essay:p>

            <essay:p>These percentages, it should be remarked, represent the pre&#172; vailing conditions of the distribution of living expenses among the inquiries so far conducted in this country. When a cost of living in&#172; quiry of a nationwide scope is conducted, the result might be dif&#172; ferent to the extent that the food percentage would be still higher and the miscellaneous group percentage still lower. Ill Having reviewed briefly the 69 inquiries of the cost of living, let us now examine more closely &quot;the standard of living&quot; of the Chinese working families, as revealed by a few studies. We shall deal in this section with food consumption for which very detailed data are now available, and discuss housing, clothing and other costs in the next one. Food: It has been shown that food costs more than half of the living expenses of a Chinese family. And of this food expenditure, cereals, that is, rice in the south of the Yangtze and cornflour and millet flour and rarely wheat flour and rice in central and north China, always constitute more than half. The proportion of expenses for various kinds of food among the working families in Shanghai and Peiping has been found as follows:&#8212; Locality Cereals % Vegeta&#172; bles % Fish meat, eggs etc. % Others % Average Total food cost per family per year Shanghai Peiping 53.2 80.0 10.9 9.1 13.2 3.2 22.7 7.7 $218.52 $144.50 It is noteworthy that the proportion of expenses for cereals and other foods among Chinese families as cited above forms a striking contrast to that in the United States. According to the 1900-20 study of the cost of living, by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, it was i</essay:p>

On the whole it may be concluded that the main characteristic of the Chinese diet is the superabundance of cereals over all the other classes of food. It is also interesting to note that the Chinese diet bears re&#172; semblances of an important character to that of Japanese and Indians. It appears that the three people, the Japanese, the Indian and the Chinese, all use rice or wheat or some other cereal product as their principal food and other edibles like meat, fish, green vegetables, con&#172; diments, as subordinate food or appetizers. Because of the very sparing use of meat as food, the three peoples are usually considered as essentially &quot;vegetarian&quot;. At any rate, the expenditure of food among the three peoples is very unequally distributed between cereals and the meat and fish to the advantage of the former.

            <essay:p>A few data of a local nature concerning the percentage dis&#172; tribution of food expenditure from Japanese and Indian and Chinese studies may now be cited for comparison. It is assumed here that the lower is the percentage of cereal expenses in the total food cost, the higher is the standard of living. It will be seen, from the table that both peasants and workers in and around Peking subsisted almost entirely on cereals, which formed from 80 per cent to 89 per cent of food expenses, while Shanghai working families which appear to fare much better in comparison spent only 53.2 per cent of the food ex&#172; penses on cereals and the remaining 46.8 per cent on subordinate foods. On the other hand, the pre-war living level among Japanese farmers appeared to be appreciably higher than both the workers and peasants in and around Peiping, as their expenses on cereals and their products constituted only 59.7 per cent to 61.9 per cent of the total food cost. The position of the labourer in Bombay in 1921-22 which is similar to that of Japanese farmer in Tokyo in 1915 is also higher than that of Peiping workers and peasants. On the whole, however, the Shanghai worker whose cereal expenses formed only 53.2 per cent of the total food cost appears to be occupying the best position of all, as far as expenditure on cereals may indicate. That cereals should constitute such a high percentage in food expenses deserves our attention. It was found that among the 136 items of food articles consumed by Peiping working families, no less than 42 items were cereals or their products. The variety of foods consumed by Shanghai working families appeared to be greater in number, being 340 kind of food articles, of which only about 16 articles definitely belonged to the cereal group. It any generalization may be drawn with regard to the food consumption among the Chinese, it seems that northern Chinese subsist mainly on a greater variety of cereals and their products, including rice, wheat millet, Indian corn, buckwheat, wild oats, sorghum (Kaoliang), while southern Chinese subsist on a greater variety of edibles except rice and wheat of the cereal group; they do not eat at all the other cereals mentioned above, either because they are not grown in the lower</essay:p>

            <essay:p>latitudes or because they are too coarse for the southern palate. In other words, the Chinese lives principally on cereal plants: rice and wheat in the south and wheat and other varieties of grain in the north. A study of food consumption involves two aspects, namely, its cost and its nutritive value. The two are not necessarily identical, for it is well known that one may pay high cost for food but get little nourishment from it. Having dealt with the distribution of the food expenditure among Chinese working families, it seems necessary to look into the nutritive aspect of their food consumption. It has been shown, for instance, that by far the greater part of the food ex&#172; penditure among Chinese working families is spent on cereals and now it would be of interest to examine whether or not such an unbalanced expenditure is reflected on nutrition as well. The main functions of food, it is well known, are first, to supply heat or energy to the body without which bodily activity would be impossible, second, to build bodily tissues and third, to regulate bodily processes. These functions involve reactions which are determined by the chemical composition and constitution of food. Any food that takes part in any of the functional processes just mentioned would have nutritive value and become a nutrient. As it would be beyond our task to discuss in detail the chemical emposition and constitution of the food consumed by the working families, we shall only consider the three nutrients, namely the carbohydrates, fats and proteins, of the food and their fuel value in calories, for which data are now found available. All the three nutrients of the food serve as fuel to yield the energy required for the activities of the body while the proteins in particular serve also to help grow bodily tissue. It has been found from an analysis of the various kinds of food consumed by Chinese working families in Shanghai, and Peiping that their respective values per equivalent adult per day are as follows:</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Proteins Fats Carbo&#172; hydrates Fuel value (grams) (grams) (grams) (calories) Shanghai 88.09 48.52 531.01 2913.41 Peiping 75.88 29.61 505.27 2595.14 It may be asked whether these values for Chinese workers and peasants are sufficient. To answer the question, we must first of all know the standard requirement of nutrients for an average person. Now the energy required in the bodily system of a person of course varies with his or her age, sex, condition of health, height and weight, kind of activities or occupations and so on. As to what dietary standard in terms of nutrients ought to be for an average adult, even specialists often differ. It seems, however, that 3,000 calories per adult per day or 100 grams of protein, 60 grams of fat and 500 grams of carbohydrates, per adult per day may be taken as the standard requirements. Judged by this standard, workers of both Peiping and Shanghai, one finds, are short of fuel value in their daily rations by calories, though the latter is not very far from meeting the standard. One finds further that protein is 25 per cent below the standard among the Peiping working families and 12 per cent below the standard among Shanghai families; fat is 40 per cent below the standard among the former and almost 12 per cent below the standard among the latter. In both cases, however, carbohydrates are higher in quantity than the standard requirements allow. This reflects well the dis&#172; proportionately high cost of cereals in food expenses as shown in the foregoing pages. Food consumption conditions in country districts appear to be also below the standard requirements. As the variety in the diets of farming families is usually very restricted, it is of necessity that a few articles are consumed in large quantities. It has been reported that the articles supplying ten per cent or more of the total food energy are, according to localities, only kaoliang, wheat, millet, corn, beans or peas, sweet potatoes and rice. But in rice growing dis&#172; tricts, as a rule, rice supplies 75 per cent of the food energy.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The sources of food energy in farming families, as found from a study of 1070 farm households in six localities in four provinces, are mainly derived from cereals and leguminous products, chiefly beans. It appears that the former constitute about 70 per cent and the latter about 15 per cent of the total energy for all foods. A com&#172; parison of the percentages of the sources of food energy for families in China and in the United States shows clearly the inferiority of the diet of the former. 1070 farm households in China Seeds &amp; their products (including cereals, legumes &amp; vegetable oil) 89.8% Animal products 1.0% Vegetables (and roots, chiefly sweet potatoes) 8.9% Sugar 0.2% Fruit 0.1% It will be observed from the above that as compared with only two- fifths in the United States, about nine-tenths of food energy in Chinese family households is from seeds and their products. Further, the Chinese farmer receives only one per cent of food energy from animal products as against the American farmer&apos;s 39 per cent; while his consumption of fruits is hardly noticeable, being only one-thirtieth of that of the American farmer, his consumption of sugar is but one-fiftieth of the latter. The food energy derived from vegetables and roots, however, is nearly the same for both groups. Regarding the fuel value, it is found that it amounts on the average to 3461 calories per adult per day in the Chinese farming families, ranging between 2176 to 4559 calories. It may perhaps be said that on the whole the fuel requirement of the Chinese farmer is suffi&#172; ciently supplied. It is further found that the food energy from protein amounts to 113 grams per adult per day, which is 12.7 per cent of total food energy and is compared favourably with the accepted standard of 10.15 per cent- 124 representative urban and rural dietaries for a period of several vears, U.S.A. 38.7% 39.2%&apos; 9.0% 10.1% 3.0%</essay:p>

            <essay:p>To sum up, it appears that in calories and protein, the mill workers in Shanghai and the farmers in six localities are either almost sufficient or abundant, while the workers in Peiping are sorely de&#172; ficient. Whereas the carbohydrate is about sufficient for the Peiping group, it is over-abundant for the Shanghai group. Fats are insuffi&#172; cient for both groups, in particular more so for the former. The nutrition of the Chinese worker and farmer so far as our limited data go, may be said to be on the whole inadequate. A closer investigation into the Chinese diet, reveals mose of its shortcomings. For instance, the quality of the proteins in the Chinese diet, it has been maintained, is decidedly inferior. Taking quality into consideration, &quot;what is a moderate allowance in the American diet becomes a bare minimum in the Chinese diet&quot;. This contention is supported by the fact that the coefficient of digestibility is much lower with cereals and legumes than with animal foods, in particular when the former two form the bulk of the diet. Only about 80 per cent, it appears, of the intake of proteins of a plant origin is available for nutrition. Looked at in this light, it is evident that the Chinese diet, even though it meets standard requirements, has still little margin of safety with regard to the protein factor. Another remark that may be made here is that apart from the insufficient quantity of vegetables and fruits consumed by Chinese,. there are lacking entirely in the Chinese diet, dairy products, such as milk, butter and cheese, which are most valuable in supplying the important mineral of calcium for bodily growth. The adequacy of calcium in the Chinese diet owing to the absence of dairy products. has been seriously questioned. With regard to vitamins, it has been stated that as the quantity of green vegetables that enter into the Chinese diet is hardly as much as that in the American diet, the supply of vitamin A is therefore very much reduced in proportion to the total food. It is consequently doubtful whether the vitamin factor in the Chinese diet is sufficient.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>It has also been stated that in view of the sparing use of eggs, the whole wheat and the less polished rice which are all important sources of vitamin B, there is every reason to believe that the Chinese diet is deficient in vitamin B. We have dealt at some length on food consumption of Chinese workers and farmers because the dietary, more than any other neces&#172; saries of life, is of fundamental importance to their health and well- being. It has been shown that Chinese diet is inadequate in many respects; at best it represents only the minimum of subsistence, below which the health of the worker and the farmer would be undermined. It is necessary to bear in mind that what} a human being requires is not merely a minimum of subsistence, for in order to carry on the various activities modern life demands in pursuing one&apos;s occupation and in performing duties of citizenship, something more than simple living must be needed. It has been well said that the goal of nutrition is not the minimum but the optimum, for while the minimum &quot;suffices to maintain and propagate the race after a fashion, it is only the optimum which makes progress&quot;. And this optimum of life&apos;s essen&#172; tials demands an ample margin of safety in dietaries for all the nutritive requirements. IV Housing. Next in importance to food is shelter which must now receive our consideration. An examination of Appendix II shows that the percentage for house rent in the total expenditure varies greatly in various inquiries, ranging from 4 percent to 16 percent of the total family expenditure. While it seems impossible to make any gen&#172; eralization regarding house rent, it may perhaps be asserted that it is considerably lower in country districts than in towns and that it frequently happens that houses occupied by farmers arc owned by them and&apos; are not paid any rents. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the construction of houses in the villages is often poorly done; proper ventilation and light in the buildings are usually un-</essay:p>

            <essay:p>provided for. On the plains in north China, owing to the absence of stones for building purposes and also the scarcity of bricks and tiles which are too expensive for poor peasants to make use of earth-walled houses prevail, which would soon collapse in case of floods and storms lasting several days. Apart from the frail character of the dwellings of Chinese peasants, it may also be said that they are as rule unfit for habitation in respect of health and cleanliness. While advance&#172; ment in education among peasants v/ould undoubtedly improve their mode of living in the housing conditions, as has been suggested by some, it seems certain however that economic progress, in particular increase of their family earnings, must precede any such improve&#172; ment. Turning to urban workers, one finds among them, as their class in other lands, the pressing problem of over crowding. If congestion happens equally in the villages, it seems that at least it is not so very harmful to them as they usually lead an open air life in the fields in most of the time in the year. In towns, however, the workers are often compelled to crowd themselves in the tiny rooms for which are charged very high rentals. Taking into consideration the few inquiries which give some detailed information regarding housing con&#172; ditions, one finds the following figures for the number of persons and of equivalent adults per room very illuminating. Each room, it may be added, measures variously from 40 to 120 sq. ft. Average number of per- Av&apos;erage number of sons per room Locality rooms per family equivalent Persons adults Peiping handicraft workers and coolies Shanghai cotton mill workers Tangku factory workers Peiping skilled workers Peiping farmers 1.04 1.42 1.72 1.56 6.38 4.16 3.29 2.67 2.49 0.85 3.041 2.59 2.03 1.96 0.64</essay:p>

            <essay:p>It will be seen from the foregoing table that handicraft workers and rickshamen of Peiping live in very crowded conditions, having 4.16 persons or 3.04 equivalent adults per room. Shanghai factory workers appear to be slightly better than Peiping handicaft workers and rickshamen, with 3.29 persons or 2.59 equivalent adults per room but in this connection it should be remembered that the Shanghai workers under investigation all lived in houses provided by factory proprietors, the rental of which is considerably lower than the usual prevailing rate charged by landlords making a living on rents. It may be seen that factory workers in Tangku and skilled artisans in Peking go up much higher in scale in their housing conditions, both having about two equivalent adults to a room. But it is noteworthy that the urban rural families have ample housing accomodation, as they have less than one person to a room. One interesting observation may now be made regarding the housing conditions of urban working families. It might be supposed that with the rise of the family income, there must be an increase of rooms per family and a corresponding decrease of the number of persons or equivalent adults per room in the family. In other words, it is expected that an improvement in economic conditions in a family must be accompanied by a similar result in housing conditions. This, however, has been found to be not necessarily true according to the inquiries into the working families in Shanghai, Peiping and Tangku. It appears from the inquiries that although the number of rooms per family increases in the higher income groups, yet the number of persons or equivalent adults per room in that group does not decrease. In short, it is found that within a certain income level the congested condition of living is by no means improved by an increase of the family income, owing to a simultaneous growth of the size of the family. This seems to suggest that while an increases of members in a family brings in a bigger income, its standard of living is not necessarily improved. Judged by either of the two standards, the official standard of the Ministry of Labour of the United Kingdom which defined over-</essay:p>

            <essay:p>crowding as more than two persons per room or the standard adopted by Professor A. T. Bowley in this study of English industrial town&quot;. which is more than one equivalent adult per room, all the Chinese working families cited in the above are living in overcrowded condi&#172; tions. If these standards are criticised as ideal, at least, too ideal for Chinese conditions, it may be observed that at any rate housing con&#172; ditions are found to be much better in other countries than in China. Whereas in none of the Chinese urban working families under dis&#172; cussion are there two rooms per family on the average, there were for instance, two rooms per family in France and Belgium, three rooms per family in Germany and four or five rooms in England and Wales, and the United States. In the case of the United States it has been found according to a cost of living inquiry published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that as the average size of the working class family was five persons or 3 to 3.5 equivalent adults, there was one person or less than one equivalent adult to a room; this is in fact higher than either of the two standards referred to. If such a comparison of housing conditions of labouring classes between China and western nations be considered unfair, we may perhaps take India. According to a study of the working class housing conditions in Parcel in Bombay in 1917-1918, it appears that a little more than 60 per cent of the families under investigation according to the British official standard or 94 per cent of the families according to Prof. Bowley&apos;s standard could be considered as overcrowded. Thus, the housing conditions of Bombay working families of even more than a decade ago were superior to those of Shanghai workers. Overcrowding has become a most serious problem in China, but this is particularly true in a city like Shanghai. In view of the soaring land values and the constant increase of population in that town, working families have little chance of getting proper housing accommodation, unless authorities take care of them. Under present circumstances it seems that there is no limit to which overcrowding of working families may not go. Instances are not at all rare where</essay:p>

            <essay:p>two and occasionally more than two families occupy one room. In this case people of different sexes of all ages to the number of seven or eight may actually huddle together in a small room of 120 sq. ft. This is, however, not the worst kind of worker&apos;s dwellings, for it is not infrequently found that lowly paid workers can only afford to live in shacks of straw and bamboo built closely with hardly any moving space and in most undesirable surroundings. It must be remarked that even the workers who live in brick built houses, can have neither privacy nor comfort; in short, there is no family life worth having. The house the Chinese Avorking family occupies has none of its traditional functions, for rest and comfort, for the enjoyment of privacy, for family gathering or the intimate communion of friends; it has none of these things but a place for sleep and there is often not sufficient space or accommoda&#172; tion even for that. The effects which such overcrowding conditions bring to the family members cannot be exaggerated. Squalor, disease. immorality and crime are but inevitable. It would be strange indeed, if a person could still live a healthy and moral life under such condi- tios. Among the many factos that contribute to the vices and crimes of Shanghai, for which it has become notorious, bad housing con&#172; ditions must be considered an important one. It is significant that the International Settlement which has always boasted of its en&#172; lightened administration, has never concerned itself with the housing problem of the poor and the working classes who live in enormous numbers under its &quot;jurisdiction.&quot; While long dissertations sup&#172; ported by statistics and documents may be produced in defence of the status of the International Settlement, looked at from the viewpoint of business and landed interests of the capitalist class of all national&#172; ities, the Chinese workers and the lower middle classes certainly re&#172; pudiate them, in view of the shameful neglect they suffer. It has been rightly criticised that while millions of dollars are spent annually m Shanghai for stock promotions, the construction of palatial hotels. clubs and office buildings, and widening of streets for the comfort and pleasure of its automobile population, not even a few hundred dollars</essay:p>

            <essay:p>are appropriated for housing the workers who come to Shanghai and contribute their labor toward the wealth of the city. One cannot help speculating for how long this city of capitalist interests will remain secure, when its municipal adminstration even in this age disregards entirely the welfare of the working population. Clothing. Clothing expenditure figures inconspicuously in the total cost of living of Chinese working families, being only as low as 2.1 per cent in one inquiry but ranging between 5 per cent and 10 per cent for about one half of the groups investigated. It seems that clothing expenses in the working families occupy as a rule around 10 per cent of their total living expenditure and only rarely more than 20 per cent. Taking into consideration the inquiries in Peiping and Shang&#172; hai, for which details on clothing are available, it is found that among the families of the former the average amount spent for clothing in a year was fourteen dollars, that is 6.8 per cent, of the total average expenses per family. The sum is truly insignificant, as it is only about three gold dollars or fourteen shillings at the pre&#172; sent rate of exchange. That clothing forms only an inconsequential part of the living of working families may be further shown by the inventory of articles made for the 48 working families in Peiping. It is found from the inventory that the garments in the possession of the 48 families were valued at the average amount of $23.72 per family, the average amount for the lowest income group being only $6.83 and the same for the highest income group being $58.85. Thus, the average amount of $23.72 represents the value of all in the ward&#172; robe of a family of 4.6 membrs. That such a scanty wardrobe should be sufficient fully demonstrates not so much negligence of clothing among such families as their straitened circumstances. It is evident that clothing economy among Chinese working families must have its limits; however, low may be their clothing expenditure, the mem&#172; bers can not possibly go about unclad or so ill-clad as to be unbecoming to their station in life. The low expenditure does not mean that clothing is dispensed with; it shows rather that it is poor in quality</essay:p>

            <essay:p>and small in quantity, and that it is either refitted or bought very cheaply at second hand. Turning to the Shanghai workers under investigation, one finds a decided improvement upon that of the Peiping workers. Their average expense for clothing amounted to $36.70 per family in the year, which is more than two and a half times that of the Peiping workers. The position of the Shanghai workers in respect to cloth&#172; ing may be supposed as the best in China since the inhabitants of that great metropolis are reputed to have a love for dress. It is therefore the more noteworthy, that their clothing expenses are far from being excessive. In fact the average annual expenditure here stated may be much still less actually, if we follow the method of ascertaining the ex&#172; penditure on clothing by dividing the total expenditure on each article of clothing by its estimated duration. Among the village families clothing constitutes 7.3 per cent of the total family expenditure. But it is remarkable that in spite of climatic conditions it is found that it is lower in north China, than in east central China, the percentages for two regions being 6.4 and 8.6 respectively. This does not mean that northern Chinese require less clothing, as the contrary would be true, but shows that they are economically inferior. Fuel and Light. In the fourth principal group of the cost of living, fuel and light, expenditure on fuel often differs greatly in various localities owing to climate conditions and the access to fuel materials. For instance, heating of rooms is a necessity in Peiping whereas it is rarely used, at least among working families, in Shang&#172; hai ; consequently much of the fuel expenditure is saved by the latter. The price of fuel is also an important consideration, as it is known, for instance, that a ton of coal may be bought near the coalfield at one dollar but ten or even twenty times that sum in distant parts.

            <essay:p>the country districts in the north, the fuel question is often solved by using the hay, stalks from various crops and wood in the hills collected from fields. It is not an uncommon sight in autumn and winter in the country to see children in their teens with a basket on the back gathering stray stalks and hay on the highways and walking paths to replenish the scanty stock of fuel materials at home. At any rate, it may be said that fuel constitutes a much less important item in the village than in urban families. It has been found that more than 10 per cent of the total average expenditure in Peiping families was for fuel and light. About 67 per cent of the expenditure was taken up by coal balls made of coal dust and earth, which form the most important fuel in Peiping. Among the Shanghai workers it has been found that fuel and light formed only 7.5 per cent of the total cost of living. It is in&#172; teresting to point out here that the consumption of firewood, which takes the place of coal fuel in Shanghai and kerosene, which is mainly for lighting, among the Shanghai workers, is similar in quantity to that among working households in Bombay. Miscellaneous Expenses.&#8212;The miscellaneous group of ex&#172; penditures formed only 3.1 per cent in the total cost of living among the Peiping workers and 20.6 per cent among the Shanghai workers- Apparently the latter have a much higher standard of living than the former in view of their high percentage of miscellaneous expenses. A closer examination of the numerous items of expense in the group shows, however, that it still leaves very much to be desired. It is important to distinguish the miscellaneous group of expenses into necessities, such as com&#172; munication, and sanitary and medical expense, without which even the minimum of subsistence level cannot be maintained, and cultural and social needs, such as education, amusements and social entertain&#172; ments which man as a social creature must satisfy. It will be seen that</essay:p>

            <essay:p>of the social and cultural expenses among the Shanghai work&#172; ers, education, including tuition fees, books, newspapers and stationery and amusements, including movies and theatricals, were respectively only 17 cents and one dollar in the year. Thus, even if the expenditure among the Shanghai workers is con&#172; sidered barely enough for necessities, it is evident that it is far from adequate for social and cultural needs. In this and the foregoing section the standard of living of the Chinese workers and peasants has been considered some&#172; what in detail from the standpoint of the consumption of com&#172; modities their cost of living paid for. The cost of living as disclosed by various inquiries, it may be pointed out here, refers only to a particular time and place, representing a static pheno&#172; menon. What is of interest and significance seems to be to find out the changes in the cost of living from time to time. Taking the cost of living of a certain class at a particular time and place as representing the living conditions as they are, we shall have to ascertain how it changes in course of time. For this purpose cost of living index &apos;numbers are usually constructed.; As the cost of living is based on a series of prices, which are the money value of commodities and represent its general purchasing power, its changes may therefore be measured by changes in the prices of the important commodities and services included in the cost of living. At present, such index numbers based on the price data collected by careful inquiries arej constructed every month in Shanghai, Peiping and Tientsin. Briefly stated the cost of living inder numbers for the last five years 1926-30, which are given below, show that there has been a rise of about 20 per cent in the period in all the three localities. This means that the working family, if it is to maintain its standard of living as is represented by its cost of living, has to spend twenty per cent more than it used to. Thus unless there is a correspond&#172; ing increase in its income, its standard of living is likely to go down by lowering its consumption in quantity or quality.</essay:p>

There is no need for us to state here that the standard at its best only approaches that of a bare subsistence. It has been shown that it is low in consideration of the high percentage for food and low7 percentage for miscel&#172; laneous items in the total expenditures. It has also been shown that the food consumption of the workers is insufficient in many ways, their housing is worse than inadequate; their clothing and sanitation as revealed by the expenses for the two groups are reduced to a minimum and the expenditure for culture or per&#172; sonal improvement is practically nil. It thus appears that the life of the Chinese worker is limited only to a bare physical exis&#172; tence. Bad as the Chinese worker&apos;s life is, it must be remembered that there are still millions of people in the country whose lot is even worse. If warfare during the last two decades has devastat&#172; ed vast areas in the country, natural catastrophes such as drought, floods, earthquakes and typhoons must have brought us havocs of a much greater scope and intensity. And the recent flood of the Yangtse River and its tributaries, which is said to be the severest of its kind for over a century, is but a culmination of the cruelties of nature. During these catastrophes millions must have died of hunger and disease, while many more who manage to survive must have been deprived of homes, fields or</essay:p>

            <essay:p>whatever estate they happen to possess. In view of this, sarcastic though it sounds, famine relief has actually become a permanently established institution in this land, indispensable to the welfare of millions. It seems therefore that both nature and man in this country have in recent years combined to work up a deadly plot against its population, denying them everything that a life re&#172; quires. And the pity is that the population, in spite of its huge numbers, seems to have been helpless before these formidable forces of destruction. It would be beyond the scope of this paper to probe into the causes of the social and natural calamities. The important question is what should wre do wdth them. In other words, what under such circumstances is needed for ameliorating the miser&#172; able living conditions of our population? This is indeed a big question to ask and in view of the complex implications of the problem, it is certainly unwise to offer remedial measures of a simple nature. Now the lowr standard of living among the Chi&#172; nese is no doubt merely a reflection of the under-production of the people. As regards under-production, either of two courses may be &apos;followed / to remain contented wdth the low standard or to increase production. The former is evidently im&#172; possible in view of the changed conditions of modern life which demands the satisfaction of material wants, asceticism of mediaeval monks being entirely out of fashion now, and more particularly in view of the fact that what Chinese suffer now is not a low living standard but often a lack of it. Thus the latter alone remains as an alternative. Now it seems that either of two policies may be adopted with a view to increasing production. One is the laissez faire policy tempered by a certain amount of state direction and inter&#172; vention, as has been more or less followed by all the industrial nations. This must be a very slow process and it is doubtful if it would ever work satisfactorily under China&apos;s present condi-</essay:p>

            <essay:p>tions. The other policy is evidently some kind of state economic planning executed with vigour. In this connection it may be suggested that recent Russian experiences are at least instructive in respect of the production of sufficient basic necessaries of life for the population. One economist who has made a thorough study of the economic life in Russia,offers the following significant remark on her industrial organization. &quot;One cannot escape the conclusion that the present organizational form is adequate for carrying on the processes of large-scale mass production to the extent necessary for the provision of the basic items which make up the modern labourers&apos; standard of living.&quot;(1) It is not our purpose here to applaud what Russia has achieved so far but what is suggested is merely that in order to promote without waste and in the shortest time possible the in&#172; dustrial and economic development of this country that would contribute to welfare of the population as a whole, some kind of planned economy undertaken by an efficient state organization appears to be highly advisable. &lt;D Hoover, The Economic Life of Soviet Russia p. 42.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>MEMORANDUM OH THE WORID DEPRESS ION AMD THE AUSTRALIAN STANDARD OP LIVING. By Dr. G&#171; L. YJbod, Associate Professor of Commerce, Univer&#172; sity of Melbourne. THE CONCEPT OF A STANDARD OF LIVING. Discussion of a national standard of living involves so many abstractions that the investigation is compelled to break the problem into factors which may be regarded as determining that standard. Any accepted standard of this sort can be useful only for comparisons of a broad general nature; and will have validity mainly for relative changes from time to time. Attempts to compare these national standards with one another are rightly regarded with the utmost sus&#172; picion by competent investigators; even when they are in sympathy with the objective. In compiling this paper, therefore, the author has been compelled to ignore external comparisons, and to concentrate almost wholly upon the variation in the Australian standard resulting from world wide economic crisis. The standard of living in this connection is thus seen to be an expression of relative prosperity; and very little more. The attempt to obtain a precise mathematical index of welfare under modern condi&#172; tions brings little satisfaction with the result. If a national standard of living has any meaning it can only be regarded as the &quot;dividend&quot; i.e. national income divided by the number of consumers, i.e. the population. Such an average, however, is too general for use&#172; ful purposes since a nation is composed of groups of income receivers, among whom the standard of living varies very widely. It is necessary, therefore, to attempt some computation of the fall in income for each group, and even this can be only an approximation. Further, the standard of living in any group needs some defini&#172; tion, since there must be an assumption of comparison among the groups selected. The standard of living of a group cannot be anything more than the sum total of utilities, i.e. goods and services at the dis&#172; posal of each of its members for the satisfaction of wants. Reckoned in terms of necessaries and luxuries, and estimated for food, shelter, clothing and higher needs in terms of money, some notion of a group standard can be obtained, The most useful computation is, of course, that for the largest group - the wage&#171;earners or breadwinners, The labourers real wage rests upon certain bases which must be noted. These bases are the position of national industries as affected by (a) the prices of its products, (b) the costs of raw materials, (c) the size of the shares of national income going to other groups who have claims on it, (d) the state of industrial technique and the efficiency of management. These are factors outside the control of wage-earners; but the standard is also affected by (a) the ability of the wage-earners</essay:p>

            <essay:p>to discover and appropriate income in competition with other groups and by (b) the ability of the wage-earners in expending wages. In addition real wages are raised or lowered by the &quot;free income&quot; of ser&#172; vices which accrue to the worker as an employee in industry, e.g. wel&#172; fare services, or as a member of society, e,g, police protection, health services, libraries, etc. The standard of living of even a single group in a community is thus seen to be an exceedingly complex thing; and very grave doubts arise as to whether its complexity is at all subject to measurement. For a whole nation, a generalisation de&#172; pendent upon an estimate of the &quot;number of appetites in relation to the volume of resources&quot; is almost worthless in a scientific sense, II. THE PRE-CRISIS STAITOARD. It has been a commonplace of discussion that Australian policy has been directed towards maintaining a high standard of living for the ordinary wage-earner. To this end there has grown up a system of wage fixation probably more complete than that of any other country outside Russia, &quot;The co-operation of such complementary factors as^the tariff, borrowing policy and the extension of mechanical technique in industry has effectively established a high standard of living in the Commonwealth&quot;.1 That this standard was high is indicated by tho com&#172; parison made by the International .Labour Office in 1926, extracts from which are here given. Real Wage Index Numbers, General Average based on Food Only, * Berlin &#187;&#8226;&#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; 84 London &#8226;.&#8226; &#187;&#8226; &lt; 100 Rome &#8226;. &#8226; * &#8226; &lt; 46 Vienna &#8226;. &#8226; &gt; &#8226; &lt; 43 Melbourne ,&#8226;&#8226; &#187;* &lt; 142 The very real omissions from an index based on food only must be recognized; but the table must be accepted as an indication of very great disparity in the post-war regimen of the cities mentioned. How far they may be regarded as trustworthy for the countries as a whole oannot be ascertained; but it may be accepted that, in comparison with that for Europe, the Australian standard for food was very high. Too much importance cannot be attached to the effect of tariff and immigration policy in maintaining the high post war standard of living for the worker in Australia, Nor can the very great importance of a lavish borrowing policy be discounted. Limitation of the income receivers on the one hand, and abnormal expansion of the income itself by means of loans and high prices for exports, on the other hand, were undoubtedly responsible for a situation that placed the Australian standard at a relatively high level. It must also be observed that th rising costs of production, consequent upon the peculiar circumstances of the national economy, were acting as a deterrent. Over production and excessive competition within the protection of a high tariff wall</essay:p>

            <essay:p>were demonstrably acting to depress real prosperity. The rising annual average of unemployment, the static productivity index, and the dis&#172; abilities of export industries through the operation of the tariff were causing uneasiness as early as 1926, The Reports of the Development and Migration Commission on Unemployment, (1927), of the British Economic Commission (1928) and of the Special Committee on the Tariff (1929) be&#172; speak this uneasiness; and seem to indicate that the permanence of the high Australian standard was seriously doubted even before the onset of world depression, III. THE FALL IN NATIONAL INCOME, The reduction of national income from exports and the vanishing of Australia&apos;s power to borrow overseas were almost simultaneous. The fall of approximainly 50 per cent in world prices for primary products and the loss of about L40,000,000 of new capital that the Commonwealth had been receiving annually constituted an economic catastrophe of the first order. &quot;Crippled in both feet, productivity and fresh capital, her financial system hobbled painfully through a period of grave crisis; and the restoration of equilibrium became the great obsession of her people.&quot;2 National receipts calculated at L650,O0O,OOO for 1928-9 have shrunk to L450,000,000 for the year, 1930-31. This represents a loss in income of about L30 per head, or L150 for every family of five in the Commonwealth. The effect of such a contraction of income Upon a country so largely dependent upon overseas markets can scarcely be described. It involved an unprecedented collapse of public credit, a shrinkage of industrial activity until one worker in every three was un&#172; employed, an adverse movement of the foreign exchange to 30 per cent, and accumulated government deficits of the order of L40,000,000, The chief effect of this situation was to concentrate the atten&#172; tion of the community on the overseas debt. The necessity for maintain&#172; ing the national credit compelled export of gold on the one hand, and maintenance of an increased volume of exports on the other. It must be remembered that the loss of gold compelled a very stringent banking policy; and the effect of a direct loss of L200,000,000 in national in&#172; come has been to compel a widespread campaign of economy and retrench&#172; ment that is not yet completed.5 In these circumstances it can easily be realised that the &quot;living fund&quot; of the community is considerably reduced. Our task is now to attempt some measurement of that reduction. IV. REAL WAGES AND UNEMPLOYMENT. Broadly considered, it may be assumed that the present rate of unemployment is more than 30 per cent, compared with the 7 per cent which was regarded as about the average rate before the depression. The in cidence of unemployment in the different states of the Commonwealth has a bearing upon the problem of the standard of living, since it is evident that the burden is heavier in some states than in others.</essay:p>

In the two stater where non-productive public expenditure per head on loan vrorks has been highest the incidence of unemployment is heaviest; and it may be assumed the decline in living standards is also greatest. A word of caution is perhaps necessary in regard to the registrar tion of unemployment, A considerable amount of criticism has been levelled at the method of calculation; and doubt has been cast upon the accuracy of the result. Most investigators, however, are satisfied that the figures are a very fair test of industrial activity, V&#187; THE FALL IH PRICES. The second factor in any computation of real wages is, of course* the effect of price fluctuations, A fall in prices comparable to the decline in employment might, of course, leave the general standard un&#172; impaired.

            <essay:p>The fall in retail prices is of the order of 13 per cent as com&#172; pared with the average for five years, 1923-27. There is thus good reason for asserting that the decline in the cost of living has compen&#172; sated to some extent for the increase in unemployment; and to that extent the fall in retail prices has helped to maintain the standard of living of the Australian worker. It may be interesting to note in this connec&#172; tion that the index of wholesale prices for Australia moved from 1719 for 1928 to 1425 for the first quarter of 1931, a fall of 17 per cent compared vrith a fall of 13 per cent in the retail price index over the same period. VI&#171; MEASUREABLE DECLINE IN GROUP INCOMES. Whilst it is not yet possible to indicate more definitely than has already been attempted the total decline in national income and the compensating fall in prices, it is necessary to make some estimate of the fall in the incomes of certain groups. For purposes of comparison the groups chosen are wage-earners, public servants, farmers and fixed income receivers. (a) Wage-earners. Fixation of wages in Australia proceeds from the minimum for the unskilled worker, known as the &quot;basic wage,&quot; to higher awards expressing &quot;margins for skill.&quot; In 1907, Mr. Justice Higgins de&#172; fined this wage and evaluated it in the Harvester Award at 7s, per day or 42s, ($10.50) for a week of 48 hours. The wage allowed 25/Vd, for food, 7s, for rent and 9/5d. for all other expenditure which was con&#172; sidered fair and reasonable for &quot;the normal needs of the average em&#172; ployee, regarded as a human being living in a civilised community.&quot; The Federal Arbitration Court by this decision assumed the leadership in wage regulation, and the Federal basic wage has since been regarded as the Australian standard wage. In 1922, the basic wage was increased by 6 d. per day, the &quot;Power&apos;s three shillings&quot;, as an expression of the rise in the cost of living since the Harvester award. The practice of the Court has, in fact, been to vary the basic wage in proportion to the cost of living, leaving the margins for skill undisturbed. The &quot;Harvester standard&quot; has been repeatedly challenged - by employers on the ground that it was too high, and by the trade unions because it was too low - and the Court itself has expressed doubts as to whether it was a satisfactory wage. Retrenchment and economy measures in private industry, and the inevitable approach of a fall in living standards owing to the decline in the value of national production, brought about an urgent necessity for a review of wage rates, &quot;Though exercising only a partial jurisdiction over wage rates, the- Commonwealth Court has long enjoyed the highest prestige among wage- fixing tribunals. Its existence and position thus afforded Australians a means of adjusting wages downwards - a problem which in Britain had proved stubborn and unyielding by the method of collective negotia-^ tions. But trade union opinion saw such a possibility with angry dismay and fought every step in the Court&apos;s consideration of the employers&apos; case for reduction. Documents produced present the reasons for a re&#172; vision of the standard wage set forth by one of the witnesses called by the Court itself.4 ___________</essay:p>

            <essay:p>During an extended hearing witnesses and advocates of all the parties represented before the Court made exhaustive examination of the economic position of the country in a sort of national inquest. The Court, after a comprehensive survey of this evidence, ordered a reduction of ten per cent in the basic wage ifor a period of twelve months and thereafter until further order, such variation to operate as from 1st February, 1931&apos;, (See Documents),4 Subsequently the Court made a rapid extension to nearly all industries coming under its juris&#172; diction.&quot; The effect on the basic wage has undoubtedly been most drastic. The wage during the first quarter of 1930 for Melbourne was 90/~. On 30th June, 1931, it was 73/-, The fall in retail prices, however, operated on the cost of living adjustment and brought the wage finally to 65/8, a drop of 24/4 per week. If that has been spread evenly over 500,000 adults affected by this reduction the monetary loss to wage- earners must be about L30,000,000, or at least 15 per cent of the entire wages bill of the Commonwealth, In addition the loss represented by &quot;rationing&quot; employment, i.e, by &quot;part time&quot; is very serious, (b) Public Services. The growing Federal and State government deficits estimated at L40,000,000 for 1930-31 had to be faced and the Loan Council appointed a subcommittee of economists and treasury officials to examine the situation. This Committee under Professor D. B, Copland brought down a drastic plan for rehabilitating government finances&#8226; It embraced, inter alia, a reduction of 20 per cent in all adjustable Government expenditure as compared with June, 1930, including all emoluments, wages, salaries and pensions. The plan as a whole was adopted by the Premiers&apos; Conference, and the provision of financial re&#172; lief by the Loan Council to the States was made conditional upon the economies being effected. With variations to suit the circumstances in each case this has now been done, with the result that public servants of every grade have shares in the fall of income, at an average of about 15 per cent, (o) Rural Producers, Both wheat and wool growers have been most serious&#172; ly affected by the fall in the world prices for their products. The average price of wool dropped from 17d, per lb, in 1927 to 8,7d, per lb, in 1931, The return for wool exported fell from L60,873,000 in 1927-8 to L27,646,000 in 1930-31, a sufficient measure of the effect of the depression upon pastoralists. Even more serious, however, on account of the more precarious nature of the enterprise in which they are engagede is the position of the wheat farmers. The value of wheat at country sidings in 1927 was 4/9 a bushel; in 1930-31 it was only l/7 or less, with costs of production estimated at about 4/3. The value of the wheat raised in Australia in 1928-9 was L20,000,000; the return for 1930-31 was only L5,000,000, This decline in receipts has to be read in the light of farm liabilities in the wheat belt. The Royal Commission on Farmers&apos; Debts which reported in August this year estimated that exclusive of debts to storekeepers, fertiliser companies, doctors, etc,, the commitments of</essay:p>

            <essay:p>20,000 farmers totalled L31,000,000, or an average of L1500 for each farm. The standard of living for many settlers on marginal lands has long since reached the bread line; and the situation presents a very difficult problem for all governments. (d) Fixed income Receivers. The application of the principle of equality of sacrifice which was adopted by the Premiers* Conference presented its greatest difficulties in the case of contractual incomes. All share and bond-holders had already participated in a loss of both capital and income. The Melbourne share price index recorded a decline from 103 in June, 1929 to 60 for June, 1931. The great difficulty was to induce bond-holders to accept a reduction in the rate of interest payable on government bonds. A voluntary conversion scheme to effect a 22g per cent reduction in interest paid on bond holdings totalling L556,000,000 was decided on, and the response has completely justified the confidence placed by the government in the spirit of the nation. At the same time the serious effect upon private incomes must be realised. Legislation has also been passed in all the states aiming at relief in the case of private mortgages; not without vigorous resistan&amp;e it is admitted. Lastly, the banking authorities notified the governments that a reduction of one per cent ,in bank rates of interest on both de&#172; posits and advances would be effected; and with that step the completion of a national scheme of readjustment, as unique as it is inspiring, is in sight.7 &#8226; &#8482; BURDEN OF TAXATION. One final consideration concerns the sacrifice imposed upon the community by the necessity for balancing government budgets. At a time when income has suffered a marked contraction, Federal and State govern&#172; ments are faced by the imperative need for higher taxation. The adverse exchange alone represents an additional charge of L10,000,000 per annum; and the felt burden of interest on the overseas debt has been doubled by reason of the fall in prices for exports. With nearly 550,000 workers unemployed the governments are also faced by the necessity of providing sustenance for approximately 1,500,000 people out of a total population of 6,500,000. Provision has been made in current budgets for relief approximating L10,000,000; but this takes no account of other relief activities. The decline in imports has meant a serious falling away in customs receipts, and on every side government revenue is threatened. The consequent increase in taxation schedules for a community suffering such drastic retrenchment must prove very serious. At least one quarter of the population is moving towards the poverty line through loss of employment; the remainder will be badly hit by increased in&#172; come and unemployment taxation. The only conclusion at which the serious student of the situation can arrive is that the whole population is feel&#172; ing the current crisis in some way; and that the severity of the reduc&#172; tion in living standards will eventually be very marked. The chief consolation to be derived is that the situation has been regarded as a national emergency, that a united effort has been demanded of the people,</essay:p>

            <essay:p>THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF INTER&#172; NATIONAL COMPARISONS OF COST OF LIVING AND FAMILY BUDGETS In all questions relating to the international regulation of labour conditions, the problem of the worker&apos;s standard of living forms an essential part. The International Labour Office has from the outset interested itself in this problem. In 1925 the Office convened an international Conference of Labour Statisticians which (among other things) discussed the methods of compiling cost of living index numbers, and in 1926 a further conference discussed the methods of conducting family budget enquiries.(1) The object of these conferences was to draw up principles and methods for the compilation of national statistics, which if adopted would render these more comparable among themselves; they take therefore no account of the difficulties introduced into the problem by differences in habits, traditions, climate, etc. between various countries and the resolutions of these conferences have been publish&#172; ed in the International Labour Review. (2) In May 1931 the Office convened a conference (the fourth) of Labour Statisticfans to consider the question of comparing &quot;real wages&quot; internationally. These comparisons as hitherto carried out by the Office, have related primarily to the European countries, the United States and the British Dominions; no attempt has been made to compare the purchasing power of wages in countries with very different standards of living; thus countries such as India, China (!)

            <essay:p>and Japan have been excluded. Moreover, they cannot really be said to measure standards of living as they refer to wages during a certain period of time of an adult male only, and take no account of the earnings of other members of the family; the number of dependent children, or other similar circumstances. The conference mentioned above passed a number of resolutions upon the comparisons of wages and cost of living internationally.(3) The interest in international comparisons of conditions of workers between the countries of Europe and North America has now ex&#172; tended to the Far East, and during the last few years, numerous studies have been made of the standard of living and of family budgets in China and Japan. The International Labour Office has taken great interest in these enquiries and has published in its Inter&#172; national Labour Review an account of the most important enquiries of which it had knowledge.(4) As yet, however, the Office has issued no report upon this subject and there is room, therefore, for a survey of the possibilities and limitations of international comparisons, both of purchasing power of wages and family budget enquiries. In the following memorandum it has not been possible to deal with all the intricate questions of a theoretical and practical nature which are involved in a complete study of this question: problems of a technical character have been largely excluded as they have been dealt with partly in the two studies on methods referred to above, and partly are likely to form the subject of a future study by the Office on international or place comparisons of cost of living. But as the possibility of making useful international comparisons (3) The resolutions of the Conference have been published in the International Labour Revieiv, July 1931.

If a given family or class of people com&#172; mands a large quantity and variety of goods and services, it is said to have a high standard; if the consumption is restricted to smaller quantities or simple qualities, it is said to have a low standard. But if it is desired to extend the use of the terms to cover several countries (or periods of time at long intervals in the same country) with a view to comparing the height of the standard of living in the various countries (or at different times) serious difficulties pre&#172; sent themselves. A severe climate makes a greater demand on housing, fuel and light, and even food, than a mild one; the fact that, the purchasing power of wages and standard of consumption is higher in England than in Italy cannot be taken as prima facie evid&#172; ence that real wages and the standard of living are higher in the former country. Climatic differences are not the only ones that hamper comparisons; political, social and economic conditions, tastes and ideals, show great variety as between different countries. To compare standards of living internationally (or between different epochs) it would be necessary to measure and add benefits derived from various kinds of commodities and services; and to arrive at the net satisfaction&#8212;which ultimately would be the only means by which &quot;real&quot; wages or &quot;standard of living&quot; can be rationally mea&#172; sured or compared&#8212;it would also be necessary to reckon with disutili&#172; ties and disabilities, whether they are caused by strain in working, social and political maladjustments,, unfavourable climate, or any similar circumstance.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>It thus finally proves impossible to arrive at a satisfactory measurement of real wages and standards of living because subjective satisfaction, its definition and measurement, pre-supposes a scale of values, the determination of which lies at present outside the domain of science. The impossibility objectively to classify standards of living as &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; has not prevented comparisons being made in practice. For everyday purposes such comparisons may be useful if it is kept in mind that the results depend upon the scale of values that the investigator consciously or unconsciously has formed for himself, and that comparisons of this nature must be arbitrary and consequently open to national and political bias. Recognising the necessary limitations to the problems of mea&#172; suring standards of living, two methods may at present be discerned by which&#8212;within certain limits&#8212;useful approximations may be ob&#172; tained- The first method is to measure the purchasing power (in a certain aggregate of commodities and services) of wages, (or in&#172; comes.) Wages constitute a chief element among the factors deter&#172; mining the workers&apos; standard of living. Between countries and period with fairly similar conditions of life, tastes and habits, &quot;real wages&quot; (or better still &quot;real incomes&quot;) are likely to represent for practical purposes standards of living with a fair degree of use&#172; fulness. The second method is to compare item for item the ele&#172; ments entering into the working-class consumption in various coun&#172; tries. The material is at hand in the various national family budet enquiries, which in addition to supplying weights for cost of living indexes, also give the most reliable picture we possess of the actua manner of living among the majority of the world&apos;s working population. II. COMPARISONS OF COST OF LIVING Calculation of real wages: The international comparison of purchasing power of wages or incomes depends essentially upon two distinct series of basic data; the level of nominal wages or incomes and the prices of the articles and services on which the</essay:p>

            <essay:p>worker spends his income. These factors may be treated separately; it is only necessary for them to be co-ordinated in so far as they should relate to the same dates, the same localities and the same categories of persons. We must leave here altogether 4he question of obtaining comparable money wages and money incomes in the different countries(5), a technical problem, whose thratment would carry us too far in the present connection. In other words, we are con&#172; sidering here only the problem of measuring the purchasing power of money wages and incomes which are considered as given. The actual co-ordination between series of wages and series of indices for cost of living involves only a simple division. As a background to the comparisons of cost of living between different places, how&#172; ever, it may be useful to reconsider briefly the general scope of time comparisons of cost of living.(6) Time comparisons of cost of living: Especially when great fluc&#172; tuations in the value of money are taking place, it is important to compare wages&#8212;not in money&#8212;but in a more stable unit of mea&#172; surement, and cost of living index numbers are computed by collect&#172; ing the retail prices of the chief articles of consumption at various dates. The prices of the different articles are weighted according to the importance of the various articles in the consumption generally of a working-class family. The use of the &quot;budgets&quot; as a basic unit of measurement, how&#172; ever, suffers from certain limitations. The consumption of the workers is changing; articles entering into the budget at one time disappear, new articles enter and the importance of the remainder changes. It is impossible to price now the budget of worker&apos;s family living a very long time ago, or (which amounts to the same thing) &lt;5) Reference should be made to the appended resolution by the fourth International Conference of Labour Statisticians upon the subject. &lt;e) See Methods of Compiling Index Numbers of the Cost of Living (Studies and Reports, Series N, No. 6) and Reoort of the Second International Conference of Labour Statisticians.

            <essay:p>to price a modern budget for a long time in the past; as habits of consumption and relative prices change; the cost of living index becomes more and more imperfect. If an old budget is modified, the basic unit of comparison is changed also and the index num&#172; bers before and after the revision in the base are not strictly com&#172; parable. This limitation in the scope of comparisons of the cost of living at various periods by means of index numbers can never be wholly overcome. The above-mentioned changes in consumption are often so slow and happen so gradually that the error introduced is confined within narrow limits, and for short periods of time it may be ignored when compared with the uncertainty introduced by the fluctuations in the level of prices. Nevertheless it is essential to remember that as soon as we want to compare cost of living at distant periods of time, we are confronted with this unavoidable limitation which has been well stated by Mr. Irving Fisher:&quot;...............we cannot con&#172; sistently compare far distant times and climes by means of averages or widely varying elements. Either we must give up the attempt or we must content ourselves with an artificially rigid system of weights which contradicts the facts&apos;&apos;. (7) General characteristics of place comparisons of cost of living: It is evident that instead of comparing prices at two different times in the same place, it is possible to compare them at two different places at the same time(8). The difficulties in making interlocal comparisons are theoretically of exactly the same order as those encountered in making time comparisons; the changes, however, in habits, traditions, income, climate, etc. between various places are very great&#8212;corres&#172; ponding in fact to very long periods of time. The problems introduc&#172; ed by making place comparisons of cost of living are, if not new in principle, of much greater magnitude, since the differences between &lt;7&gt; The Making of Index Numbers, p. 247. &lt;8&gt; See in this connection Methods of Compiling Cost of Living Index Numbers, p. 7, footnote.

            <essay:p>a series of localities are usually greater than between a series of years. The great differences between various places makes it necessary, therefore, to develop a technique of comparison by which it is possible to deal with this kind of difficulty. Moreover, as the comparisons, to be really useful, should extend over several countries, difficulties of an administrative order arise. An international enquiry demands the co-operation of many national authorities and offers greater difficulties than a national comparison in applying uniform methods. Items to be included in Budgets: As was pointed out in the Office&apos;s Report on Methods of Compiling Cost of Living Index Num&#172; bers, &quot;the earliest attempts to measure changes in the cost of living were usually based on changes in the prices in a given locality of a comparatively few items of ordinary consumption, mainly of food, heating and lighting.....If the movements of the prices of the groups of commodities not included were similar to those of the groups chosen, no purpose would be served by extending the scope of the enquiry. There is, however, abundant evidence to show that the movements, for example, of food prices since 1914 have been very different from those of the prices of other commodities, and in consequence adjustment of wages by means of index numbers of food prices could hardly be expected to give satisfaction&quot;.(9) The above holds true-&#8212;mutatis mutandis&#8212;for place index numbers. It is known that the relative dearness of various groups of commodi&#172; ties varies considerably between different places; it is thus evident that to compile a satisfactory place index number, prices of all im&#172; portant items should be admitted into the comparison. However, it is in practice difficult to enlarge the framework of the comparison. It may be easy to obtain price quotations regularly for certain staple qualities of food, fuel, etc. per kg-, litre or dozen. To get quota&#172; tions for rent is at once more difficult; a &quot;room&quot; does not mean the same thing in all localities. Great local variations exist in the (9&gt; loc. cit. p. 9.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>qualities of articles of clothing; the obstacles in selecting and pricing items of &quot;cultural&quot; expenditure and personal services are still greater. The International Labour Office has always considered that satis&#172; factory compilation of data can be secured only on the basis of close international co-operation. Enquiries regarding qualities and kind of commodities and services to be included in the budgets would best be conducted on the spot by means of personal visits to the different countries. Such procedure becomes the more necessary if&#8212;as recommended by the fourth international Conference of Labour Statisticians&#8212;the basis of comparison should contain in addition to prices on food, also particulars on fuel and light and housing.(]0) Methods of compiling budgets: In the previously mentioned study by the International Labour Office upon the compiling of index numbers, distinction is made between three methods of compiling the budgets: the aggregate expenditure method, the standard budget method, and the theoretical budget method. In making place com&#172; parisons, it is theoretically possible to use any one or a combination of these methods. It is not necessary to repeat here reasons for and against them. It must be remarked, however, that in the present state of international statistics it is necessary to take refuge to a large extent in arbitrarily prepared budgets. The statistical material is as yet too scarce to allow the application of standard budgets for suffi&#172; ciently large areas. Another question is that in constructing inter&#172; national budgets, existing family budget enquiries and national cost of living indices, form the necessary groundwork. Basis of comparison: Comparisons of cost of living may be calculated on a &quot;fixed&quot; or a &quot;chain&quot; basis. The former system is &lt;10&gt; Partly owing to experiences acquired in the course of the &quot;Ford en&#172; quiry&quot; which is at present being carried on by the Office it was deemed inadvisable to include also expenditure on clothing and mis&#172; cellaneous items.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>employed in compiling practically all national &quot;time&quot; index numbers, owing, no doubt, largely to its simplicity and ease of handling. The latter system has so far won little ground in practical statistics. These two systems are here examined from the point of view of compiling &quot;place&quot; index numbers of cost of living. Fixed base system: By the fixed base system of comparing cost of living, the same budget of commodities and services is priced in all the localities concerned. A form of such comparison is some&#172; times carried out within the same country; the budgets used in com&#172; piling national index numbers of cost of living are priced in various localities. To be of value, the localites should have fairly homo&#172; geneous conditions of living. In other words, the comparison should not be extended over a greater area than that for which the national budget offers an adequate expression of habits of consumption. It would perhaps be possible to measure the cost of living in Scandinavian towns upon a budget from any of the three countries of Denmark. Norway and Sweden: it would not be adequate to use a single national budget in comparing the cost of living in Copenhagen and in London. It is necessary to take into account the conditions of consumption prevailing in London and in Copenhagen. Comparisons taking into account the conditions in all the localities concerned may be under&#172; taken by means of different methods. The most obvious way to account for national differences is perhaps to calculate the cost of living on the basis of several regional budgets.(n) This method was employed by the International Labour Office before 1929. The cost of six regional budgets of foodstuffs was calculated in each of the towns included in the enquiry; the result, consequently, was six index numbers of cost of living for each town. To arrive at a unified and simple expression of the relative cost of living, these six indices were averaged; the result being an inter- (ID Throughout this memorandum the word &quot;regional&quot; is used in the sense of a group of countries having similar habits and customs.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>national cost of living index number, which to a certain extent, took into account the particular food habits in various parts of the world. From a purely practical point of view, this system suffered from being cumbersome in handling. The compilation of six series of indices for each town and then averaging them, involved a great amount of labour. This work may be greatly decreased and account still taken of the consumption habits in each country&#8212;by averaging the budgets (the weights) instead of the final ratios (the indices). In fact it has been demonstrated experimentally that practical results reached by this method are almost the same as by the former method. (12&gt; For this reason from 1929 to 1931 the International Labour Office made its computations on a single &quot;international&quot; budget obtained by aggre&#172; gating the regional budgets instead of computing six different indices and taking the average. The Fourth International Conference of Labour Statisticians did not take definite sides as to which of the above methods is preferable and resolved only that: &quot;Allowance should be made for the difference in articles consumed in each of the countries by basing the calculations successively on the list of important articles &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;.consumed in the others&quot;. All comparisons of cost of living of this nature, however, are subject to certain limita&#172; tions and it was pointed out by the Conference that they &quot;cannot be usefully made between countries of widely differing customs and habits&quot;. This is to say that when in two or more countries the field of common consumption is a small one (or with another terminology; &quot;the common factor&quot; is low),&lt;18&gt; comparisons are apt to be uncertain. The International Labour Office has always recognised this limitation and has never attempted to include in its enquiry regions with con&#172; ditions as different from modern Western industrial standards as, for instance, the Far-Eastern countries. A general treatment of this problem is given by Irving Fisher in his Making of Index Numbers (see specially chapter VIII, pp. 184-196). See for instance, J. M. Keynes, A Treatise on Money, Vol. I, pp. 105-109.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>In actual practice, however, it is more rarely desired to compare the standard, of living in China with Great Britain or Argentina&#8212; comparisons which, on account of the great differences in habits hardly can be worth while&#8212;but rather with countries and districts of similar conditions: China with Japan or Korea, or perhaps with India; the North of China with the South of China, industrial districts with less industrialised areas; and so on. According to this view, the fourth International Conference passed a resolution that the cal&#172; culation of place index numbers of cost of living &quot;should be made not only as hitherto on a fixed international budget, but also on the basis of various national or regional budgets&quot;. Thus, comparisons between countries situated in the same region could be made on a fixed budget, being a composite of the various national budgets in this region; a comparison between countries situated in different regions&#8212;if practical&#8212;could be made on a fixed budget being a com&#172; posite of the relevant regional budgets, and so on. It was pointed out in the introduction that the information on consumption habits in the Far East is rapidly accumulating as a con&#172; sequence of the vivid interest, both public and individual, shown in conducting family budget enquiries. It would seem therefore as if it now would be possible to establish comparisons of cost of living between various countries and localities in a Far Eastern region. Which countries and classes of people should be included and in what detail the comparison should be carried out is a practical question that cannot be answered here. &quot;Chain&quot; base system : It is useful to take into account also the &quot;chain&quot; base system as a means of comparing cost of living in places with widely differing conditions of life by progressing from the similar to the dissimilar through places with intermediate conditions.(14) (14) F0ir a more technical description of the &quot;chain&quot; system, reference is made to Irving Fisher The Making of Index Numbers, pp. 18-22; and for a critical analysis to J. M. Keynes, A Treatise on Money, VoL I. pp. 116-120. Mr. Keynes, however, overlooks some impoi&apos;tant aspects of the problem and especially the difficulties which arise in deter&#172; mining&apos; the &quot;similarity&quot; of various localities.

            <essay:p>It is sometimes believed that this system gives more satisfactory results than a system of direct comparison. However attractive the method may seem, it is nevertheless subject to very important limitations, both practical and theoretical. In recognition of these limitations the fourth Conference of Labour Satisticians passed the following resolution: &quot;The Conference is unable to recommend the proposal to com&#172; pare countries of dissimilar conditions by progression through coun&#172; tries with intermediate conditions owing to the lack of information on such conditions at the present time and to the absence of any criterion for measuring the degree of dissimilarity among the intermediate countries.&quot; III. FURTHER COMPARISONS OF REAL INCOME AND STANDARD OF LIVING The Second International Conference of Labour Statisticians held in Geneva in 1925 expressed the opinion that, since the figures of real wages based on rates of wages of adult male workers &quot;cannot be considered as represenative of the real differences in the workers&apos; standard of living which exist from country to country, it is desirable that a second series of index numbers should be published along with the first, measuring the relative standard of living of the working classes in the different countries. In this case it would be class families and take account of the difference in the physiological reeds of the population, due chiefly to climate and race&quot;. It has, to the knowledge of the Office, never actually been attempt&#172; ed to compare standards of living in the above manner. Theoretically the problem is of the same order as that of comparing real wages. Since it is impossible to measure the total satisfaction of populations, it would be necessary to find a standard of comparing the purchasing power of the total incomes of the families concerned. This involves problems of a highly technical order, which as yet have not successfully been solved. As at present an index of this kind seems to lie outside practical politics, it does not seem necessary to deal at any length</essay:p>

            <essay:p>with the methods suitable to be employed in the construction of such an index. It will suffice for the moment to indicate some of the most obvious difficulties-&#8212;apart from those encountered in comparing real wages&#8212;which would have to be faced in the construction of such an index. Determining family income: There are considerable difficulties in ascertaining on a uniform basis the wages paid for work during a certain period of time. Account must be taken of payments in kind, insurance contributions, etc. When comparing the total income of a worker it is necessary to account for payments for overtime and for all other extra sources of income. It would also be necessary to take into account unemployment and short time. Moreover, the earn&#172; ings of the wife and other members of the family are of great im&#172; portance. At present continuous statistical information upon family incomes is not available, and it would be necessary either to commence a new series of statistics in the countries concerned, or to make very far-reaching abstractions on the basis of information of this kind con&#172; tained in the national family budget enquiries and similar sources. Moreover, when calculating real wages it proved necessary to include the indirect advantages which a person enjoys as a consequence of his normal employment; it is often difficult to ascertain the value of these benefits. To obtain a correct picture of the standard of living, it is necessary to reckon with a greatly increased number of indirect benefits; free services rendered to the members of the family by States and municipalities in the form of social and educational services, hygienic measures and other activities to increase health and wellbeing, by charity, and by members of the household in the form of cooking, washing, mending, etc. It presents great difficulties to arrive at a valuation in money of these benefits as they, as a rule, have no market value. Size of family: The prosperity of a family depends ceteris paribus on how many people there are to share in the family income. This factor does not enter into the determining of real wages, but may</essay:p>

            <essay:p>be a deciding influence on standards of living. Several ways could be imagined of overcoming the effects of the fluctuations in the size of the family; the most near at hand is perhaps to use a common unit of consumption, that of an &quot;adult male&quot; being the most generally employed.(12) It would be going too far to enter here on a detailed examination of this concept; but a few general observations will be made. An &quot;adult male&quot; does not in all cases mean the same thing; consequently it shares with the family a certain ambiguity as basic unit of measuring consumption. Due to differences in race, age, physical, climatological, occupational and similar circumstances, the &quot;adult male&quot; shows a great variety as to his needs in different times and at different places; persons with small physical needs may be as well off in coun&#172; tries with low standards of consumption as persons with larger needs in countries with highest standards. The concept of an &quot;adult male&quot; has a definite meaning only when wre are dealing with homogeneous groups living under fairly similar conditions of life. This conditions, as a rule, is fulfilled only in national enquiries and the usefulness of the concept rapidly decreases as the comparison is extended to cover groups with dissimilar conditions of living. The variations in the needs of the &quot;adult male&quot; causes a further difficulty in applying the method. It has been customary to represent the needs of the other members of the family by some more or less appropriate fraction of the food of the adult male. From the point of view of international comparison, serious objections may be raised against this procedure. It has been pointed out as early as 1917 by H. C. Sherman, in the introduction to a study by L. H. Gilette(16&gt; that &quot;the food requirement of a man varies so greatly, according to his occupation, that it seems hardly logical to make this the basis for estimating the dietary needs See Methods of Conducting Family Budget Enquiries, International Labour Office Studies and Reports. Series N, No. 9, pp. 45-54. ) A Survey of Evidence Regarding Food Allowances for Healthy Children, New York, 1917, p. 3.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>of the family. Thus a carpenter may require 3,500 calories per day, a tailor, 2,500, a 14-year-old son of either of these men, 2,800 calories. With the carpenter as a unit, the boy&apos;s requirements would be reprsent- ed by 0.8 of that of the father; but with the tailor as the unit, the allowance of 0.8 would obviously provide for too little food for the boy&apos;s needs.&quot; As occupational and similar circumstances vary widely between different countries, it is evident that the same scale universally applied would be void of definite meaning. In constructing different scales of reduction for different countries, new difficulties are created; it is always a matter of doubt whether the various scales give strictly com&#172; parable results. Furthermore, the scales in actual use are practically all based on the consumption of food only. It is evident that the relations existing between various members of the family as regards the need of food, do not necessarily hold true also as to clothing, housing, cultural expenditure, tobacco, and beverages. The share of the family income that goes to various needs and members of the family is influenced not only by objectively ascertainable needs&#8212;such as is supposed to be the basis of the nutritive scales&#8212;but also by the social status of a family and by its standard of living generally. The purpose of reducing the family to a common unit of consumption, however, is to measure differences of standards of living. It turns out, however, that the scale proposed&#8212;at least partially&#8212;is a function of the phenomenon it is intended to record; it is consequently, at the best, an instrument of limited usefulness. If tastes, ideals and habits are similar, the error introduced may possibly be neglected; this is not the case in comparing countries with widely different habits of consumption and standards of living. The method should&#8212;if at all&#8212;be employed on international comparisons with the greatest reserve. IV.

            <essay:p>&quot;In order to provide adequate information with regard to to the actual standards of living, enquiries should be conducted at intervals generally of not more than ten years into the income, expenditure and and conditions of living of families representative of large homo&#172; genous sections of the population&quot;. The Fourth International Conference again emphasised the need of family budget enquiries in countries where such have not been made during the last ten years. In agreement with the above resolutions, the International Labour Office proposes to compile and compare the results of enquiries carried out during the last ten-year period. A study of this kind should bring together systematically the elements which constitute the standard of living and give, because of its wealth of concise information, a more vivid picture of the actual living conditions than index numbers of real wages or standard of living, into which, by the very nature of things, averages of heterogenous elements must be crammed. Perio&#172; dical studies of this nature would form a useful complement to the Office studies of real wages. But it would also seem particularly useful to undertake comparisons for shorter periods of time and a group of countries for which a study of living conditions is desired (e.g. the Far East). It is not necessary here to discuss the manner in which family budget enquiries should be conducted to give comparable results. This question has been dealt with by the Office in the previously mentioned study on the methods of conducting family budget enquiries and by the resolutions passed by the Third International Conference of Labour Statisticians in 1926 (See Appendix). Very little that is new has in fact been forthcoming since that time. Experience gained later, especially in connection with certain special enquiries has only showed the need of still closer international co-operation in the preparing and conducting of national investigations. Still, however, different national enquiries show great differences in scope and methods. To make use of the extensive and valuable</essay:p>

            <essay:p>material contained in the various enquiries for international compari&#172; sons, it is necessary to account for at least the more important of these differences. In the absence of an analysis of the source material the risk of false or misleading conclusions is great. Some of the most important factors influencing the comparability of various enqui&#172; ries are enumerated in the following; they may roughly be combined in four groups. The first group deals with the uncertainty brought into the com&#172; parison by changes in the times between the carrying out of the en&#172; quiries. If the conditions are stable in the countries compared, this factor is negligible, but in the case of rapid change, it is of great importance. In comparing the results of two enquiries, one of which was conducted before or during the Great War, and the other in another country during a recent year, only a little information is given as to the relation between the manner of living in the two countries at a given moment. The second group includes factors pertinent to the representative&#172; ness of the investigated families. Uniformity in this respect depends upon the methods used in selecting the families whose conditions are to be compared. In the first place it is important that the enquiries should refer to the same kind of localities, or that different kinds of localities in all cases should be given a weight which corresponds to the conditions in each country. It is impossible to compare the results of enquiries which in one country include only agricultural, and n another only industrial districts. But even where the enquiries refer to industrial districts, it should be kept in mind that conditions of living vary considerably as between localities of different size even within a country. The result of a comparison will often turn out differently depending upon the weight given to large and small towns in various enquiries. It is necessary also to keep in mind differences with respect to the social and economic situation of the families compared; to be comparable, enquiries should refer to corresponding classes; in practice</essay:p>

            <essay:p>budget enquiries are limited to one or two classes:&#8212;industrial wages- earners and salaried employees. But the working class especially contains many strata receiving different wages and living at different standards, and the result of a comparison is influenced by the selection of families within the working class. Generally the method of con&#172; ducting enquiries through household books kept by the householders themselves tends to result in an over-representation of the better part of the working class. It is among this group that the necessary ability and interest to keep detailed records during a long period of time is most commonly to be found. But depending on many cir&#172; cumstances&#8212;the interest and capability of the working class, the resources and methods of the investigating agent, etc. the degree of misrepresentation varies considerably between the different enquiries. In practically all budget enquiries it has been deemed necessary to lay down certain conditions as to the composition of the families to be included in the enquiry. Generally the families selected cor&#172; respond to some notion of a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;typical&quot; family, and consist of husband, wife, and a certain number of children. The result is that the families included in the enquiries are only exceptionally representative of the actual demographical conditions in their respective countries. As the size of the family is one of the determining factors of the standard of living it is evident that this factor must be given consideration in comparing the results. Thirdly in making comparisons it is necessary to consider the value of the material in the various studies. A small number of families or a short duration of the enquiry leaves much room for accidental and exceptional circumstances to influence the results. In drawing conclusions from studies resting on a narrow statistical basis, the greatest care must be exercised not to stress the results too far. Similarly tbe methods used in collecting the material influence the results; for instance, when the householders themselves keep their records, the results will tend to become biassed, as the better part of the working class probably is too heavily represented. It is also probable that the very fact of keeping records will influence the</essay:p>

            <essay:p>habits of spending, as the householders often for the first time get a collective picture of their expenditure. An enquiry, the material for which is gained by the &quot;enquete&quot; or census method will have a dif&#172; ferent bias, and so forth. Fourthly, the results of comparisons are influenced by the methods of compiling the material. It is from the international point of view of secondary interest to ascertain which are the best methods of com&#172; pilation, as the comparability is affected by the degree of uniformity only. It is, for instance, of no consequence whether expenditure on laundry is given under the head of clothing or under &quot;sundries&quot;, as long as it is given under the same head in all enquiries; the com&#172; parability ceases first when articles in two enquiries are recorded under various heads. Where differences of this nature occur it is possible to make necessary corrections when the results are published in sufficient detail. Comparison of the percentage of income spent on the main groups of expenditure should be avoided unless the com&#172; position of these groups is ascertained. Likewise in this connection the question of the statistical unit has to be reconsidered. It has already been mentioned that the family as a basic unit suffers from serious shortcomings, and that attempts to avoid them by reducing the family to a common unit of consumption has hardly proved successful. It is difficult to see any special reason why the consumption unit should be introduced here more than in previous cases and it seems at present most practical to retain the family as the basic unit of comparison. It would be easy to continue to enumerate a great many difficulties encountered when comparing the results of various family budget enquiries. What already has been said, however, suffices to show the nature of the problem and little would be gained here by giving further details. The important question is in which direction and with what force the various factors make their influence felt.

It will be found as a rule that this qualitative analysis offers comparatively little dif&#172; ficulty. It is generally easy to see in which direction each factor separately affects the result. This, however, is a thing quite different from knowing how the result of the various factors turns out in the aggregate. To ascertain this it would be necessary to measure the various influences quantitatively. As this under our present methods is out of reach, we cannot compare the various results with any degree of certitude. A qualitative analysis, however, subjective and arbitrary though it may be, is to be preferred to the uncertainty of no such valuation at all.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>[IE STANDARD OF LIVING- IN CHINA AND JAPAN An Essay on Policy Bv C. Delisle Burns. The standard of living of the majority of workers in the Western Pacific area is recognised to be lower than that in European countries, as the standard In European countries is lower than that in North America. To raise that standard is a primary interest of the whole world; and to say that it is a British interest does not Imply that British Interest in this matter is opposed to any other. Indeed this Is one of the cases in which a British Interest means a common Interest of all, in which the British people by their own action can share. It is assumed for the purpose here in view that the British and international interest in raising the standard of living in the East is not merely commercial or financial. Politically a rising standard of living would ensure stability and security for the future, and it would increase friendliness In International relations * Again, a rising standard of living involves cultural advance, in the extension of the applications of science to practical problems, the Improvement of popular education, the&quot; better status of women and the increase In the use of leisure. All these ends are in view when policy aims at raising the standard; but here attention will be directed mainly to the economic aspects of the problem. The abnormal conditions of the moment - the fall in silver, internal warfare in China, and the world depression - are disregarded in what follows. The problem discussed is the more permanent deficiency of purchasing- power among the majority in China and Japan. British Economic Interests. The British interest in the standard of living in countries in the West Pacific area arises out of the importance to us of (a) exports of our manufactures to these countries, (b) openings for investment of capital there and (c) exports from these countries, some of which may be used In Great Britain. The incidental interest arising out of exports and imports is that of (d) shipping services which may be under the British flag. 1. The Royal Institute of International Affairs, as such, is precluded by Its rules from expressing an opinion on any aspect of International affairs. Any opinions expressed in this paper are, therefore, purely Individual.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>All those British interests would be promoted by a higher standard of living in the East involving more purchasing power, that is to say, larger &quot;markets&quot; there. The increase of such markets would&apos; increase employment in Great Britain. Policy should, therefore, be such as to secure a steady and, if possible, rapid raising of the standard. This raising of the standard of living for the majority in China and Japan is mainly dependent upon local conditions; but the action of foreign Governments and business enterprises can do much to increase the purchasing-power and improve its use among the Eastern peoples. Above all in the modern world the raising of the standard of living is an international problem, whose solution would overcome difficulties arising out of tariffs and economic nationalism. We have today in the International Labour Office and the Economic and Financial Section of the League of Nations suitable international instruments of this policy of raising the standard without fear of imperialism or of national rivalries. Examples of the British interest in a raising of the standard of living are as follows:- (a) Exports of British Manufactures to China. These have been in the&apos; past chiefly cottorfgoods | but it would be foolish to imagine that British interests are confined to cotton exports or will necessarily always be chiefly concerned with these. The markets and the productive powers in different countries are changing; and one trade or one commodity may be displaced by another, within the whole of the export trade of any one country. Thus the cotton exports of Great Britain to China have certainly decreased, because the Chinese have purchasing- power only enough for the cheaper Japanese manufactures, but perhaps^also because of monetary conditions in China. On the other hand the value of all the exports of Great Britain to China, taken together, have not noticeably decreased. Goods from Great Britain imnorted into&quot; China were valued at 133 million taels in 1927, 174 million in 1928 and 193 million in 1929. The goods exported were different; but it can hardly be said that British interests suffer if cotton goods, for example, are displaced In the markets by textile machinery from Great Britain. The chief British exports to China now are (*) cotton goods, of which the Department of Overseas Trade Report says &quot;that &quot;the more impoverished districts have noy turned entirely to the cheaper local and Japanese productions&quot;. The impoverished districts obviously are those with a deterio&#172; rating&apos;&quot; standard of living. The recent report of the British 1. Department of Overseas Trade. Economic Conditions in China,&apos;1930; p.55.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>(k) Increase in Investments The resources of China are usually regarded as undeveloped; the investment of European and in particular British capital is &quot;by no means large considering the size and population of the country. The economically &quot;backward&apos;* areas of the world at this moment lack capital0 and in most cases foreign capital supplied improves the supply of local capital. A higher standard of living in a population normally involves more accumulation of capital and a more efficient use of capital - especially in the form of &quot;family11 capital, e.g. houses, farm-supplies, etc. But this causes an extension of banking and of the services connected with banking. In view of the important positions already held by British banks in the East, these results of a rising standard are obviously a British interest. The mere account of the capital supplied and the mere increase in banking business, however, are not half so important as the direction of the investment and the policy of the banks. That is to say,&quot; investment should favour increased transport facilities first. Finance should be the servant, not the master, of industry and commerce . The facilities or new methods in the use of credit are more important than the mere amount of credit supplied; and in a new situation old traditions and habits may be misleading. (c) Exports from China and Japan. . A higher standard of living is accompanied by greater productive power: and this productive power often shows itself in increased exports, which enter the markets hitherto supplied by older manufacturing countries . It may be falsely supposed that it is not a British interest to increase the power of China and Japan to manufacture for export, especially as in India, for example, Japanese cotton goods are obviously being sold in markets hitherto supplied by British exporters. But a British interest can never safely be confined to an interest In one trade: and in any case it could hardly be maintained that it is a British interest to obstruct the development of the export trade of countries In the Western Pacific. Indeed the increase of purchasing power In Japan,owing to the higher standard of 3.iving under industrialisation, has actually led to an Increase of Imports into Japan. Prom Japan we take silk and silk.tissue and also knitted goods, chiefly of cotton. But apart from our direct gain in the import of Japanese goods to Great Britain (It is assumed that to buy cheaply abroad is not a disadvantage to uhe buyer5.), it is clear that the industrialisation of Japan has led to Increased foreign trade between Japan and other countries. In which increase Great Britain has shared. Similarly the power of China to manufacture for her own internal markets, although it may interfere with the old markets supplied by British manufacturers, increases the purchasing power of China and opens markets for new&apos;products which maybe supplied by British firms, if they have &quot;the ability to grasp the</essay:p>

            <essay:p>new situation. (d) Shipping Services; The carrying trade on the seas of the Western Pacific is still largely British, Hongkong depends upon a maintenance of these services. The total value of the foreign trade of China in 1929 was 2.281 million taels of which 388 million was with Hongkong! the trade with the rest of the British Empire amounted to 349 million taels. In general the markets of the world are changing, as will be noted below; and therefore British interests cannot be the same as they were in the nineteenth century. Not only has &quot;economic nationalism&apos;&apos; supported the supply by each nation of its own needs, but the kinds of goods demanded are changing. A far greater proportion of non-essential goods is needed in the modern world; the production of the old staple goods is perhaps in excess of the needs of the world; but in any case British policy must look forward and not back. We must aim at securing new markets, not at retaining the old markets. New sections of^the population in most countries are providing markets for &quot;foreign&quot; goods; and the character of these new markets (in new goods and services) will depend largely upon changes in the standard of living. What is the Standard of Living. The standard of living is understood to mean the goods and services available for use by any person or group of persons, regarded as a whole, comparable with some other &#163;um of goods and services. Thus the calculation of the standard involves a knowledge of (a) necessaries, - food, clothing and house-room or shelter, (b) luxuries or non-essentials including educational facilities, recreational opportunities etc. In both cases - for necessaries and &quot;luxuries&quot; - some of the supply is provided by expenditure of a personal money-Income (wage or salary) and some by &quot;publicfi or co-operative agency supplying goods and services in kind. The standard therefore in any group depends partly upon a family or Individual income and partly upon public services so that the standard of living in England, for example,^is calcu&#172; lated both by reference to incomes and to supplies in kind such as public education, drainage, roads, open spaces, etc. The amount of money represented for each individual or family by the public services of a civilised country It Is probably impossible to state; for the joint supply cannot be divided Into a mere collection^of units supplied. &quot;The standard,even In economic terms, is social. The amount of vitality or energy that any person derives from</essay:p>

            <essay:p>services available depends upon the whole social situation in which he finds himself. The standard of living in any country differs in different social classes of which the chief are (a) those with large incomes, (b) the &quot;&apos;professiomUf&apos; workers, (c) the wage- earners and (d) the poor. The expenditure of these different classes differs greatly in most countries, and the advantages differ, which they derive from public services . But for the purpose of the argument here the standard of living of the two classes, (b) professional and (c) wage-earning, are selected for consideration.. In reference to the standard or standards of these two classes only there is a traditional contrast between the standards of different peoples or races: and that largely because the incomes of these two classes only are traditionally thought of in terms of &quot;cost of production&quot;. Wages and salaries (one element only in the standard of living) are considered as cost of production and not as purchasing power; but obviously it is as purchasing power that they affect most deeply the international situation today. That is to s,ay, the world now needs &quot;markets&quot; to take up its , surplus productivity? it needs more purchasing-power, not more production - or more proeaacTtioia only ln_~scY~^^~as more production giiTelTTnc^ &apos;Therefore the.....consideration of the standard of&apos; living should have primarily in view the possibility of increasing the power to purchase goods of those who at present lack power. The importance of the standard of living in China and other Eastern countries, from our point of view, is that they are potential markets, - that their peoples have less purchasing- power than they could use for efficient living. Current misunderstandings are dangerous. The comparison between standards of living is not the same as a comparison between costs of living {even in some common unit of calculation). Thus tho cost ,of living in Japan in 1913 was about half the cost of living IrTlJ.S.A. (in comparable currencies): but the standard of living in Japan may not have been lower, if the Japanese worker derived as much vitality, energy, enjoyment or social life from his expen&#172; diture. Similarly today, the&quot;cost of living for a French worker max be lower than the cost for the&apos;&quot;British worker; but because the French worker&apos;s food is better cooked, he derives more (in the standard of living) from a smaller wage or less earnings. Again, the social situation in different countries makes it very dangerous to compare standards of living except in very limited reference to the amount of health, etc. available in any two cases. For example, the family system in the East results in certain &quot;costs&quot; (maintenance of old or incompetent or unemployed members); but it also results in large &quot;gains&quot; (e.g. security, cheaper goods through co-operation,etc.). It is most unwise to suppose, as certain writers on China do, that the Chinese practice of maintaining theatrical performances is &quot;waste&apos;&apos; or thrit it should be sacrificed in order to get more food or clothing or housing.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Raising the standard of living does not mean destroying the traditional culture of any country. The modernisation of the Chinese, for example, does not mean their &quot;Americanisation&quot;; for the standard of living In any country m.ay be higher than the American v/ith a far lower rate of the exchange or amount of the exchange of goods and services. With due precautions, however, it may be suggested that the standard of living (not necessarily the rates of wages) should be increased in China and Japan; that is to say., measures may be taken to eliminate disease, to diminish waste effort in transport, cultivation, etc., to reduce the death- re te, to reduce the birth-rate, to extend public services or co&#172; operative enterprises in education, child, welfare, etc. Each man, woman and child and each group of human beings has a certain amount of vitality, energy and ability or intelligence . At the present time the available amount of such vitality and Intelligence is dependent upon the health, knowledge and endurance possible under the given social conditions in any corner of the world. But certain groups or certain nations have undeveloped or unused or obstructed vitality and energy: there Is more in them than comes &quot;into play&quot;. They have capacities which have no outlets; or the capacities of the earlier years of life are stunted by lack of food or education or social stability. Such groups have a standard of living which is lower than it might be; and to raise the standard of living of such groups means not merely to give them, more productive power but also more skill in the use of such abilities as they may have and such resources as are undor their hands. The vast majority of men and women can obtain more power to use goods and services only by giving more services . What they spend Is dependent upon what they earn. But powe to earn depends upon health, bodily com&#172; petence, skill and intelligence ~ ail of which again depend not only upon &quot;the accident of birth&quot; In each individual but also upon the store of common tradition and common dally experience available for each. The New Industrial Revolution. Tho standard is changing all over the world, not mainly in the level., but in the kind of goods and services required. Wo are now passing through a revolution in economic and cultural life, more fundamental than the so-called industrial revolution of a century ago: and therefore (1) the business and industrial policy of those in control will have to be drastically altered, if good results are to be expected and (2) the political issues in the relationships between peoples will have to be reconsidered upon a new basis.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The general character of the social revolution of today is due first to the immense increase in productive power and, secondly, to the tendency towards greater expenditure upon entirely new leisure-utilities. The Increase of productive power is occurring in almost all countries of the world, in agriculture (through mechanisation and. the application of science to crops) as well as in industry (repetition-process, rationalisa&#172; tion, etc.)&#187; This involves a much greater potential wealth por head of population in the whole world than has ever been possible in all human history. It means that distribution, not production, is our problem; for the greater wealth may not be more equally shared unless the standard of living of low-standard countries is raised. And secondly, the new revolution has given us the gramophone, the cinema, the radio, and - partly for leisure uses - the motor-car, the aeroplane, etc. This means that there arc more ways of spending income upon non-necessaries than ever- before; and the new ways are affecting not only America and Europe but also Africa and Asia. The result of a greater productivity per head of population is that the family-Income in economically advanced countries Is increasingly spent not on maintenance of children, etc but on leisure; and If the survival-rate in the world becomes stable, thus reversing the tendency to rapid Increase of population in the nineteenth century, all countries will spend more upon &quot;luxuries&quot; - or upon the new commodities. But this again is a problem of distribution. It is a problem of markets. Not only are the old markets in certain goods (e.g. cotton goods) proportion&apos; ally declining, but new markets in new goods are developing (e.g. rayon, gramophones, cinemas, aeroplanes, etc.). ^Tiat the world now needs Is a policy of the market. The raising of the standard of living in China and Japan, like the raising of the standard in Africa, is essential for the absorption of the supplies available under the new system of production. The_ Present Standard in the Western Pacific. Evidence will bo before the Conference as to the actual standard of living in China and Japan. It is not possible for anyone unacquainted with those countries to make contributions to a knowledge of the facts; and &quot;no man can see farther Into a generalisation than his knowledge of detail extends&quot;. Therefore what now follows must be regarded as merely an Impression gained by reading a small section of the available literature and a very general statement of a point of view with regard to the lives of the vast majority. This major%, without adequate voice In the direction oi policy and hitherto neglected in international affairs, Is the living body with which policy should be primarily concerned. Not</essay:p>

            <essay:p>the interests of traders or financiers, nor the success of those in control of government, but the vitality and intelligence of common folk, are assumed here to be of the first importance; and it is because the farm-worker, the factory-worker^ the transport-worker and the clerk nave not an adequate share of the benefits which accrue from modern civilisation that it is pro&#172; posed as a principle of policy to raise the standard of living. The immense waste in each generation of potential capacities of common folk, owing to poverty, ignorance and private&#8226;greed, makes it desirable that public policy should provide for a better dis&#172; tribution of available goods and services. The West cannot claim any great superiority over the East in the principles of policy hitherto predominant. Evidence of poverty is common in all the great city-areas of the West. In Great Britain in 1924 there were more than four million persons living below the poverty-line, that is to say with less goods and services than are necessary for a barely human existence, The number in the same situation in the United States is about ten million. But knowledge and organising ability are being applied in the West to the solution of this ancient problem. It is not therefore as morally superior beings, but only because the West has acquired some skill In&apos;the solution of problems similar to those of China and Japan, that one can consider the methods of raising the standard of living In those countries. Again, it is not suggested that the West Is wiser than the East or more generous in its policy towards other races. It is only tnat In the West we have, by trial and error, discovered some methods which may be useful for Eastern peoples to apply at their own will and for their own purposes. The missionary was typical of the West In the East In the first period of contact; the trader in the second. In the third period now beginning, the expert, the engineer and tne worker in preventive medicine are those who are typical of the West In the East. A new relation&#172; ship Is arising. So far as can be seen from a distance, the present standard of living In China and Japan is revealed In recent Reports.

            <essay:p>or in sections of tropical Africa. It Is not lower than the standard was in most of mediaeval Europe. But whereas in earlier times the knowledge and ability were not available for raising the standard, now they are available. We now know the chemistry of soils, bacteriology and plant-breeding, the principles of human diet, the most efficient ways of clothing and &#176;f Planning dwellings. And all this knowledge can be made available, m the East as well as elsewhere, at a certain cost. But the Increase of efficiency, due to the application of---- modern knowledge and skill, provides the cost. That is to say modernisation pays for Itself. Indus tr I&apos;ll workers In China form a very small proportion oT-The population, and to raise their standard of livingowould not seriously affect the situation. But undoubted&#172; ly their standard of living should be Improved by the proper administration of factory Acts, by better housing conditions, etc Industrialisation has Improved the general standard of living by reducing labour wastage in transport and manufacture and however low the earnings in factories they are higher than those of domestic industry. But the well-known Report on Child Labour in Shanghai J- describes incidental evils. Child labour, insani&#172; tary working and living conditions, long hours and low wages, &apos;all reduce vitality, shorten life and prevent the rise in the standard of living that could otherwise be secured by the extension of modern industry in China. The standard of living of factory workers in Shanghai has been analysed by Mr. H.D. Lamson of Shanghai College; 2&amp; and in an analysis in the Chinese Economic Journal for August and September 1930,3 The InrernaTTonaTT^Dour^ for April ^ gives a summary of the results, which &quot;is sufficient to show the small amount of expenditure which is possible under the present system for any working-class families. i\3pPendix t0 &#163;aP.&#176;-rs respecting Labour Conditions in China, British White Paper, &apos;&apos;clE^2fI^=or=i:g2o^&#8212;&quot; . &apos; ......... 2, The Standard of Living of Factory Workers; a Study of Incomes and Expenditures of 21 Working Families&quot; (Chinese ~^SL&#176;I}omic Journal, novembcr 1930.) &#8212;&quot;---- 3* ^Shanghai Labour.!? by Fang Fu-an.

            <essay:p>1 A valuable review made in 1918 by Kokichi Morimoto of the standard of living In Japan shows the minimum cost of living in Tokyo at that date to be about 960 yen or $480. The cost has gone up since that date and there are probably great numbers who have not a secure Income of that amount. The Report of the British Consul (Cmd.511 of 1920) on &quot;Japanese Labour&quot; seems to Indicate a real lack of adequate food etc., among great numbers. It is asserted however by a Japanese writer that &quot;the wage earners at least are enjoying a much higher standard of living than in former days&quot; 2 but the evidence drawn from an increase in the consumption of rice per head of population and of an increase in normal wage-rates as compared with a price^Index (either wholesale or retail, not distinguished) is oxuite inadequate. Various reviews have been made as to the cost of living for workers (e.g. that on labourers In Osaka in 1921). Family budgets in Japan are analysed In Taijire Matsuda&apos;s paper for the nineteenth Session of the International Institute of Statistics, Tokyo, 1930. Mr. E.F. Penrose&apos;s statistical data in Food Supply and Raw Materials in Japan 4 seem to indicate that while the population in~JWS~a^s~r7r^^ supplies of food and clothing have increased still more rapidly. There is, however, no indication of any change in distribution of wealth in these figures, and therefore it is difficult to discover from them how far the standard of living of wage-earners may have risen. The birth-rate in Japan (about 34 ner thousand) is almost the same as the birth&#172; rate In North-West Europe was in the 1880&apos;s: and there is no such organised opposition to birth-control in Japan as exists in Europe. 1 &#8226; Mqrimoto, Kokichi ;__Standard of Living in Japan. 1918.(Baltimore&#8226;&quot; Johns Hopkins Press .) 2.

            <essay:p>Raising the Standard of Living. Before considering the means by which the standard of living in the East can be raised, it may be well to note that the &quot;recent rivalry between low wage-rates, for example, In Japan, and higher rates in Great Britain, is a sign of the rising: rate of earnings among Japanese workers. The change from domestic to industrial production generally raises the rate of earnings for the workers concerned; although it lowers the cost of production. What happened a century ago is too often&apos;Torgotten, British manufacturers caused &quot;unemployment&quot; among the&quot;hand-workers of the East by &quot;dumping&quot; the products of machine-labour upon the Eastern markets. The cost of production was lower in Great Britain as long as Great Britain bad the monopoly of machine labour. Now the situation is reversed. Industrialisation in the East is undercutting British goods, just as a century ago industrialisation in Europe undercut Eastern&apos;goods . The East has been able to recover equality In manufacturing power not by lowering but by raising the rate of earnings of the workers and, through mechanisation and increased wage-rates, lowering the cost of production of Eastern goods and services &#8226; Contemporary controversies in Great Britain need not be discussed here: but it must not be assumed that a lower cost of production Implies lower wage-rates. Obviously lower costs can be accompanied by higher earnings only If there is enough brains or ability in Industrial organisation and business policy; and it Is sometimes necessary to make sacrifices or to make other people make sacrifices, if the supply of ability is Inadequate. Thus during the War a lack of brains meant the sacrifice of men in the so-called &quot;war of attrition&quot;. On the other hand, reduction of costs Is the traditional nineteenth century method for raising the standard of living. The lower the price, the larger the market. The nineteenth century first lowered the price and then enlarged the market; but jt is not an eternal or universally applicable policy. The markets can be enlarged by (1) better salesmanship, (2) easier or more flexible credit supplies for the purchases, (3) creation oi new products or new types of product, etc. The alternative to lowering ^reduction costs in order to enter the Chinese market, for example, is a direct increase of the productivity and therefore of the earning power of the Chinese. The buyer can be given more power to buy - even by giving him more health to work with - by other means than by the seller&apos;s reduction of prices. The nineteenth century was dominated by producers5 economics.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>State action on labour conditions. Again State action has actually raised low wage-rate! by Trade Acts, Trade Boards, Pt-c and has added to purchasing-power by unemployment benefits and&apos;nealth insurance. It should be noted that the legislation has been much less important than administration (inspection, legal process, etc.) in arriving at the result. 2. Voluntary association in Trade Unions has done something to raise the standard of living both by securing fixed wage-rates and by &quot;benefits&quot; out ef Trade Union funds. In a period of falling prices some unions have been able to resist the too rapid reduction of wage-rates and they have helped to improve tne standard of living of their members. 3. Consumers&apos; Cooperative Societies have increased purchasiiTg-power and~s&quot;e&quot;c&quot;5r?a better goods for consumption. The local Cooperatives have become much more able to raise the standard pr^ce. The English and Scottish Cooperative Societies have developed large-scale buying and manufacture. 4 Culturally, education and an increased security of expectation have led to a reduced Mrth-rote ^therefore an expenditure in each family upon fewer persons.

The improvement of health will increase the productivity and general energy of the population. Water supplies, drainage and the provision of open spaces In city &apos; areas all lead to greater vitality, resulting In more purchasing- power for the majority. The reduction of the disease-Sate and of the infantile death-rate would release energies at present hampered by mediaeval conditions. The North Manchurian Plague Prevention Service is an outstanding example of what can be done. Tnose in control of government in each locality, as well as any central Government, can establish administration of health services Voluntary local or group associations, for the improvement of conditions by cooperation, can produce immediate results upon the standard of living. It is quite unnecessary lor groups or localities to wait for large-scale governmental action; bhe example of Mr. P.L. Brayne&#187;s work In Indian villages in Gurgaon proves what can be done. It is not nossible without close study of the conditions in China and Japan to say what forms^these voluntary efforts are taking or should take. ~But the principle of small-scale spontaneous local cooperation for production in agriculture, for marketing produce or for purchase . that principle is not in doubt. Rural Cooperatives already established in China have followed upon the traditional small- scale mutual aid familiar to farmers and they have already raised the available income and capital-supplies of Chinese farmers. 1. The point of Interest for us In the West is that in &#9632;the West there is a store of medical, agricultural and commercial knowledge and skill, which may be of use in the East. There is no doubt whatever that the knowledge of sanitation, for example, or of diet, or of the growth of plants is much greater in the West than in the mediaeval areas of the East: and this knowledge can be made available for raising the standard of living of the vast majority in China, without any Western domination or Western privileges. Indeed the withdrawal of Western countries from, any position of privilege for their nationals may give eastern countries a better opportunity of modernising their own lives. Japan and Turkey are examples of spontaneous modernisation. The customs See Hsu,Paul C: Rural Cooperatives in China. 1929 (Honolulu- Institute of Pacific Relations&quot;^ 8vc~7T6pp7T</essay:p>

            <essay:p>of the countries concerned may have to be radically changed before a great improvement in the standard is possible. In particular the birth-rate must be diminished.! This will occur perhaps, as in Turkey to-day, by the spread of a knowledge of methods of birth-control, but&apos; it must depend partially upon the diminution of the need of child-labour to &apos; add to the family income,, This need for child labour exists when adults&apos; wage-rates are very low, as in some textile areas even in Great Britain. But it may be due partly to the inefficiency of adult labour owing to low vitality and malnutrition. In addition to governmental or voluntary organisations of China and Japan which can raise the standard of living, there are now international instruments which may be used for the same purpose. The International Labour Organisation, for example, has already had a great effect upon countries newly industrialised and upon other countries with low standards of living. The influence of the International Labour Office has led to (1) improved factory legislation, (2) more efficient administration of industrial and social legislation, (3) recognition of trade unions and other organisations of workers, (4) shorter hours and better &quot;spacing&quot; of work times, (5) increased knowledge among employers and organisers of industry of the latest and most efficient lighting, placing of machinery, etc.2 so far the International Labour Office has been concerned mainly with the improvement of Industrial conditions- but its competence estends to agricultural conditions also. In the whole field of employment its influence has been and should increasingly be effectual in raising the standard of living, not only by improving &quot;conditions&quot; but also by Increasing purchasing-power. The increase of purchasing-power by higher wage-rates Is sometimes advocated, even by those who support the Inter&#172; national Labour Office, on the&quot;entirely wrong ground that it will increase the cost of production of their competitors. Similarly it is sometimes said that the influence of the International Labour Office in shortening hours in certain See the Rep_9Jl^,-of ^he^ojyai&quot;_Commission on Agriculture in India (p.499) ;~&#8482;&quot;No lasting improvement in the standard of living can possibly be attained if every engancement in the purchasing power of the cultivator is to be followed by a proportionate increase in the population.&quot; See Ayusawa, Iwao F.: Japan and the League of Nations. 1926.

            <essay:p>they are to be tastes for foreign goods. Again, the ancient and threadbare controversy of Protection and Free Trade obscures the present situation. Even if every foreign product were kept out by a Protective Tariff the markets of any nation would not&apos;be&quot; enough to take up &apos;the excess of the new productive power in that nation. We are suffering - not from Malthus&apos;s pressure of population on the means of subsistence but from an opposite evil - the pressure of over-supply upon a diminishing or stable popu&#172; lation. The problem is no longer one of rivalry between different nations but of distribution of purchasing-power within all nations. And similarly with regard to&apos;the traditional Free Trade - if all the tariffs of the world were abolished some increase in the markets would, no doubt, follow as the Economic Conference at Geneva in 1927 declared; but the abolition of tariffs alone would not increase the markets sufficiently for modern productive power. The most urgent need is redistribution of purchasing-power so that the low standard countries can buy more of the supplies available. A policy of that kind requires large-scale thinking and long-range administrative and busimess ability. It requires - not rhetoric, nor &quot;good will&quot;, nor sentimental affection between the incompetent in all nations - but hard-headed analysis of facts and clear imagination in seeing what does not yet exist. No doubt the current business of finance and. commerce requires some ability to think in statistics&quot; but constructive policy requires more - it requires the ability to think in terms of men, women and children - that is to say in terms of the standard of living. A policy which raised the standard of living in Asia would cause the recovery of the whole world from the present economic depression,, Finally, the raising of the standard of living Is the best method for counteracting social chaos arising out of discontent or despair. Much of what is called &quot;Communism&quot; In Europe - whatever may be the case In the East - Is due to real distress - real lack of food and employment. Despair tends to recklessness. Those who have nothing to lose are naturally inclined to blind change; for they hope that something better may turn up and. they feel that, whatever turns up, it cannot be worse than their present situation. Therefore a real improvement in health, vitality and social intercourse - which is a raising of the Standard of living -</essay:p>

            <essay:p>will secure any community against reckless adventure. The theories of Communism are beside the point. In Germany and in France certainly the movement called Communist is fomented. by actual lack of food: and It seems to one looking from a distance that In China also what is called Communism is largely the reaction*of despair against a low standard of living. To raise that standard would therefore Increase social stability. Similarly a rising standard of living for common folk prevents the growth of hostility to foreign persons or foreign goods. When men are starving, it is easy to persuade them that their sufferings are due to foreign devils&quot; or to &quot;Imperialistic capitalists&quot;. But If a larger supply of goods and services are available, the development of civilised life by international Intercourse will become more attractive; and there may be less tendency to international friction. This does not mean that foreign nations will be better able to have their &quot;own way. A higher standard of living in China, for example, will increase and. not diminish the Chinese demand for the abolition of foreign privileges; but that Is all to the good. It may be said that this argument is merely the old. advocacy for buying off opposition to established oppression by offering some scraps to the barking dogs. Indeed some revolutionaries look forward to greater suffering as a means of stirring common folk to revolt. But apart from theories - common folk should have more health; and we can discuss the results upon the forms of government afterwards. It is impossible to base policy upon &quot;the collapse of the capitalist system&quot; or &quot;tho danger of world revolution&quot; or the prospects of war in the East or the decline of British exports. But as an interim policy for the situation, as it now is, a raising of fJhe &quot;standard of living In China and Japan is desirable and attainable by quite definite measures. Such measures, even if they lead to the withdrawal of Western domination or Western privileges, will also make Eastern peoples more able to undertake the tasks of administration, judicial procedure and. constructive economic policy, upon which improvement of civilised life both In the East and in the West depends. Each Government concerned and the business organisations of different We stern nations can adopt a deliberate policy for the raising of the standard of living In the East. Pacification and the establishment of settled government is a presupposition of economic orogress. But beyond that - Governments and traders and financiers can view the field not as a battlefield of competition but as an opportunity for interlocking action, in which each promotes the Increase of purchasing-power, some of the uses of which will accrue to others. It is a better policy - even In economic terms - to cooperate for the extension of new markets</essay:p>

            <essay:p>than to scramble for the remnants of a shrinking market. If the market shrinks, through famine or disorder, the best policy is not to cut costs of production but to nrevent the shrinkage of the market and to increase its power to absorb products. Expenditure on health, education and friendliness f or f oreigners ac tual 1 y does &quot;paySi , No raising of the standard of living in the East is likely in the near future to remove ojf_ti1&#163;lely the difficulties arising out of the relation between&apos; &apos;communities which have different (not necessarily 1owe r an d highe r) s tand a rd s. These difficulties show themselves in obstacles set un to immigration and in competition in the export trades. Japanese, for example, are willing to work for less pay and under simpler conditions than those acceptable to Westerners. If Eastern people are prevented from migration, they will be Industrialised and thus forced into entering the export markets of the Western peoples. It would be fantastic to imagine that a people Is less &apos;&apos;civilised&quot; if It can maintain a culture with less expenditure in the exchange of services than another people; for neither happiness nor civil&#172; ised life is proportionate to the amount of income available for a man or a group of men. But the use of such Income as is available may be more or less skilful; and differences of culture or of the traditional civilisations should not obscure the fact that each culture or civilisation Is growing. To Improve the standard of living among the people of China and Japan is not to make them more like Americans or Europeans, but more able to use their own traditions and their own present abilities. The standard of living, in past times, has risen largely because of international intercourse. Great Britain is not now Inhabited by Ancient Britons or Anglo-Saxons. Woad and mead have &quot;gone out&quot;. Artifical silk and radio-sets have come in &#8226;- largely owing to foreign trade and to the transit of odeas across frontiers. Prance was the most civilised European nation In the eighteenth century because Prance was the meeting-place for all the different European groups or nations. Thus an Institute such as the Institute of Pacific Relations is a good Instrument for that Intercourse upon which the raising of the standard of living depends. International Intercourse, however, is not only a cause of the rising in the standard: it Is also the result of such a rising. In proportion, as the standard In any country rises, the dependence of that country upon other countries increases.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>THE SITBJUGJTTO.TJ OF A PROVINCE THE STORY -Ti^ THE I^.1I^E COUNTRY 0? VICTORIA., AUSTRALIA. By A. S. Eenycn, LI&#171;I.3# Australia gineer, Victorian State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. Perhaps no more interesting problem in agrioultural economics exists than that ox&apos; the development of a farm on land virgin to the plow and the farmer&apos;s flocks* In almost all cases, of course, the agriculturalist follows in the footsteps of the pastoralist; but in the Victorian Mallee, the pastoralist had occupied but small portions; indeed, by far the greater par&apos; was covered with dense scrub and yielded nothing of %alue to man. It harboured the dingo, that deadly menace to the flocks of the squatters en the adjoining plains and that was all. &quot;Mallee&quot; is a well known term in Australia and is applied generally - certainly in the South Eastern States of South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria - to a somewhat stunted grou.p of Sucalypts which grow on the fringe of the arid country. The arid country embraces those areas where the annual rainfall falls definite]y below ten inches and then the Mulga (acacia aneura) takes its place. The Mallee includes Eucalyptus dumosa (once the generic term for the whole group and still often used in that way), gracilis, uncinata, oleosa, behriana, incrassata, polyoractea, viridis and some less common species. The name is of aboriginal origin and, at the inception, was spelt Mawlee, Liar lie and Mall ay &#8226; The present spelling., with a pronunciation rhyming with Sally, was adopted ahout 1850, The Mallee has a numher of stems - possibly tetter described as &quot;branches - springing from a massive root or trunk which is &quot;below the surface. This halit of growth is distinctly due to the arid conditions of its life #nd permits of a considerable storage of moisture. The roots are a well known and favorite fuel. Amongst this scrub the mound-building Mallee hen, leipoa ocellata, is found. LOCATION. .Administration from a distance of 13.000 miles gave to Victoria as a western boundary a straight line, the 141st meridian. If it had thought of making a parallel, that of 36&#176;, the boundary on the north, it would have excluded practically the whoie of what is known as the &quot;Mallee Country&quot;. In other words, the Mallee country lies</essay:p>

            <essay:p>north of the rest of Victoria and embraces the north-western part of that State. It is differentiated from the river plains forming the surrounding country by its vegetation and by the absence of any system of watercourses. It obtained its name from the dwarf forms of Eucalyptus to be found all over it and, in places, exclusively occupying its surface. It is roughly triangular in shape, having the Murray River on the north, the South Australian boundary on the west, and on the south and east a line, more or less straight, running from Swan Hill in a general south-westerly direction to Dimboola, and thence west to the South Australian boundary. Detached portions known as the Little Mallee, between the Avoca and Loddon Rivers, and the Little Desert south of Nhill, complete the Mallee area. All told, it embraces over one-fifth of the State, or more than 11,000,000 acres. Not only is it marked out by its physical features, but it is separated from other crown land in legislation. Special inducements and conditions were needed for its successful settlement, whether pastoral or agricultural* DESCRIPTION. The eleven million acres are not covered with dense low scrub, nor is the country flat, as popularly supposed. There are four general divisions - the scrub country, generally consisting of sandy ridges running easterly and westerly with red loam flats all covered with mallee from eight to twenty feet in height, probably 50 per cent of the whole; the broken country, consisting of open, grassy plains, pine and belar ridges, big mallee up to sixty*feet in height and all sorts of smaller trees, such as quandongs (fusamis). pittosporums, hakeas, grevilleas, heterodendrons, mycporums, eremophilas, acacias, &amp;Cc, mostly peculiar to the area as far as Victoria is concerned; the heath country, of infertile white sands, generally in steep blown hills,&quot; covered with epacridae and sandy loving forms of vegetation, banksias, casuarinas, hakeas &amp;o., and stunted forms of mallee, the frontage country to the Murray River, with its large box and led gum flats and bordering pine and hop bush countryo More or less every&#172; where is found the &quot;porcupine&quot; grass (triodia irritans) - &quot;Ballarock&quot; or &quot;Wallock&quot; ef the blacks, erroneously given as &quot;Spinifew&quot; on many official plans. It is rarely found on the heathy country, and more rarely on the best class of land. There occur also in the northern portion considerable areas under saltbushes. EARLY OPINION. Yery little has been yet written about the Mallee Country, and little of that is laudatory. Even the blacks gave the early settlers alarming accounts of its trackless regions and of reptiles miles in length which awaited the luckless traveller who dared enter. Mothers threatened their children with its horrors if they misbehaved. Nehemiah Bartley, who was on the Murray</essay:p>

This soil is oovey-ed [ as thickly nearly as they will grow) with bare saplings twelve feet long and two inches thick of the Eucalyptus Duinosa, &quot;bearing a tuft of leaves only on the top, and springing, perhaps, a dozen cf these dreary sticks from a root, or ball, that rises just above the ground; this only and nothing more of any kind; no birds, no insects, no animals, for there is nothing for them to live upon, and only a rare snake. Woe to the traveller who gets lost in this terrible desolation; he can see no distance; he can climb no hill; and if the Mallee sticks would bear him on the top, he would only see Mallee, Mallee, Mallee all around him&apos;T.$~:Pr. Neumayer was not impressed with its possibilities. Describing the country south of Kulkyne, most of which is broken country and of gotd quality, he writes &quot;that horrible rogion covered with porcupine grass and stunted scrubs. The sandhills are so numerous that one might with no great difficulty, imagine oneself tc be amongst tho hummocks on the soc-shoro*&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226; Eere and there the monotony of the Mallee scrub was broken by groups of fino pine trees, otherwise nothing else was to be seen and not a sound to be heard.&quot;/ The climax is reached, however, in the description due to Mr*A&#187;Patchett Martin, then Secretary to a Royal Commission on&apos;Crown Lands, who as a result of a trip in 1878 over Dr. Neumayer1s route from Swan Hill to Eulkyne, and thence by Tioga and Yollumgip to the settled country, is responsible for the following fine piece of word painting, which it has been tho fashion to quote in most reports on the Mallee. It must be remembered, however, that at that time the lessees, who had no term of tenure of these holdings, united in presenting everything in the most repellent aspect, partly, it may bo surmised, to reduce payments, but mainly to discourage any outsiders attempting to come in, Mr. Martin wrote referring to the Mallee country generally: - &quot;The aspect it presents is that cf a wilderness in the strictest sense of the term - sand, scrub, and mallee below, the scorching sun and bright blue sky above, and not a sound of life to break the solemn silence.

In the south-west, near Serviceton, 75 per cent of the annual precipitation falls in the eight wheat-growing months, whereas near Suston at Bumbang, less than 62 per cent falls in the same period. Again, in the eastern and northern portions, the total rainfall for a year may be as little as four inches, while in the western, and southern parts the minimum annual falls are in some cases not less than eleven or twelve inches. The rainfall in any one year is not, however, such an important factor as might at first be thought. Where fallowing is practicable - and practised it must be if settlement is^to be successful - excellent and very profitable crops have been raised on less than four inches of rain&quot;during the growing period. The yields obtained by the best Mallee farmers are about the same throughout, though the rainfalls of the different parts of the district vary very much. The average fall over the whole Malleo is fourteen inches, with a range from nineteen in the south to eleven in the extreme north-west. It has been proved that wheat farming can be carried on profitably where the annual rainfall is as low as ten inches. A marked peculiarity of the Mallee is the great variability of the soils. The best class is a red sandy loam with a subsoil much resembling the surface, but containing a greater percentage of clay. There is always more or less grass, r.nd numerous plains occur. Where the mallee bush predominates the soil is generally lighter in colour and. contains more clay, the subsoils in some cases being fairly tough. The vegetation is generally mallee, more or less low in habit, depending upon the number of fires which have swept it and the #= Keport of the Crown Lands Commission of Enquiry, Victoria, 1879,</essay:p>

            <essay:p>period elapsed since tho last. In the ordinary malleo country there is at times a considerable amount of limestone, mostly travertine. Victorian farmers &#9632; generally look upon limey land v/ith distrust, but South Australian farmers, who are good judges of poor land, havo a better opinion of it. There are considerable areas of salt bush country generally associated with salt lakes and copi (gypsum). It is practically worth&#172; less for agriculture. Mallee soils are in such a condition of aeration from their lacustrine and aeolian origin and of desiccation from their arid situation that none of the accepted standards as to quality is of service in judging an analysis of these soils. They are practically devoid^of humus, and become for lengthened periods, especially in the subsoil, devoid of all interstitial and capillary moisture. A fair average Victorian mallee soil, yielding in favorable seasons over 30 bushels of wheat to the acre, contains about .5 per cent potash (K#0) against .25 per cent the accepted standard for a good soil, .04 per cent -ohosphoric acid L$z0q) against .15 per cent, 1 per cent of lime (CaO) against .5 per cent, and .08 per cent nitrogen against .15 per cent. The great deficiency in phosphoric acid is readily made up by dressings of from one-half to one hundredweight of superphosphate of 18 r)or cent v/ater soluble phosphoric acid contents or- 36 per cent calculated as monocalcic phosphate, No beneficial result has been attained by othor dressings, such as nitrogenous manures. In South Australia the mallee soils contain less phosphoric acid, averaging about .02 per cent and heavier dressings of superphosphate are successfully employed. The alkali contents of Victorian mallee soils vary very much. Unfortunately, very few determinations of them are available. The chlorine contents also vary greatly. Where in large quantity, it is, in the form of common salt, generally found associated v/ith sulphate of lime or gypsum. In the surface soils in the wheat-growing areas&quot; it is generally under .01 per cent, but reaches as high a figure as .15 per cent. (The figures given are for chlorine. Sixty-five per cent should be added to bring them to the equivalent of common salt or sodic chloride). The latter instance is one of the best Victorian mallee soils, which yield very large returns of wheat. In the subsoils the salt contents are much higher. Crops of hay, oats, and wheat have been profitably grown on soils containing much larger quantities of salt than thoso figured above, and having, in addition, very large percentages of gypsum; land so salt that its natural vegetation is practically all samphire or beadbush (salicornia Australis).

            <essay:p>carrying mallee scrub mixed with saltbush (atriplex sp.), but cultivation of thoso exclusively growing saltbush or bluebush (kochia sedifolia) has not boon so successful, these soil &#9632; being generally too heavy and too clayey for the light rainfalls. It may be broadly stated that the sandier the soil the lower its apparent value by analysis, though this is not confirmed by actual experience in culti&#172; vation* Red sands are the richest. Yellow sands are t)oor, while white sands unless of no great depth and over&#172; lying a clay subsoil are practically worthless. Observation of the class of soils, and particularly of the vegetation growing upon it, will yield the only reliable result. So far, soil analysis has only proved a hindrance to mallee settlement, and had it been heeded, some of the best districts in this and the adjoining States would still bo unsettled, instead of turning out yields of up to 45 bushels to the acre. V/ATER SUPPLY. The adjoining Wirnmera district and the Malleo country are remarkably well served by probably the most extensive, comprehensive, and effective individual schcmo of domestic supply channels existing in any part of the v/orld. The scheme serves 11,000 square miles ^o&#177; territory, of which over 7,000 square miles are within the Mallee country. For this purpose there are storages at Lake Lonsdale, Fyan&apos;s, Taylor1s, and Pine Lakes, and Wartook of a total capacity of 200,000 acre feet, and &#8226;oublic channels aggregating 6,000 miles in length. The greatest distance the water travels from storage is .300 miles - to Annuello, in the Mallee. There are approximately 12,000 holdings, each with its own excavated tank or reservoir, which is filled from the channel system, no matter how great its capacity once a year during the cool months. In addition, no less than 40 towns are supplied with water through pipe reticulations. Other systems, the supply of which is by pumping from the River Murray, serve the Coreena, Carwarp and Millewa districts. Where bore water is unobtainable and channel extensions are not immediately practicable, tanks, dependent upon local catchment, are put down. They vary from 200 cubic yards, covered, to 50,000 cubic yards, dopending upfen the area and quality of catchment, twenty acres being generally reckoned as required for each 1,000 cubic yards. A recent innovation is the making of what are known locally as &quot;ironclad&quot; catchments. In these, sheets of flat galvanised iron joined together are laid upon half an acre of sloping ground: the run-off, closely approximating 100 per cent, is caught in a ooncrete-lined, iron-rooiea tank of 65,000 gallons capacity.

The system has proved itself. In the south-west of the Mallee - an area bounded by the Wirnmera River and its extension to Pine Plains on the east and the 35th parallel on the north - underground water of a useful quality is obtainable. It is struck at depths of 100 to 600 feet under beds of estuarial blue clay and in marine limestones of miocene age. It rises to&apos;levels of from 300 feet to 15D feet above ordinary low water (Kobson&apos;s Bay), and has a northerly gradient. In low localities, salt bush and copi country, its hydraulic level is higher than the surface, and it becomes artesian. In most parts the surface level is too high, and the water has to be lifted by pumping, tho lift being as great as 250 feet. Generally the motive power employed is windmills, twelve feet in diameter, with thirty feet towers. Outside the area mentioned, salt water only has been found by boring. FARMING METHODS. The first operation in bringing the land into productive occupation is to get rid of the scrub. This can only be effected over a period of time, which at the best is four years, and should not exceed six or seven years. If the vegetation is of a light order, say scrub not more than ten or fifteen feet in height, it is rolled down by the well-known mallee roller, drawn by bullock or horse teams, and occasionally by traction engines - steam or oil. Horse teams require skilful driving, and all large mallee trees must be well &quot;nicked1 , or there is a considerable risk of injury to the teams. In the case of the larger mallee, or of pine or buloko country, cutting down by hand is resorted to. In this case, cutting stumps axe&quot;handle high is sometimes done, the branches being piled around the stumps which are scorched and frequently killed outright. The cost of rollin. which is frequently dene by contract, varies from 3s.6d. for very light low mallee and broom scrubs to 4s.6d. and 6s. for the heavier mallee; hand cutting starts at about 7s.6d. per acre, and will go up as high as 15s. The rolling&quot;or cutting must be done in the winter months, July to September, in order that a fair grov/th of shoots may- have occurred before burning-off time (February to April inclusive). Burning off, which involves the clearing of a chain strip around the whole of the rolled area as a fire&#172; break, costs a few ponce per acre, and if lucky in the</essay:p>

Burnt mallee cannot &quot;be cleared, unless at, an additional cost of at least 4s. to 5s. per a.cre, until five or six years after the burn. When the roots are killed, a completely different method of farming must be undertaken. About one-third ef the total area is to be ploughed from July to September fo .&apos; fallow; one weed-harrowing in October (if the spring &quot;be good, two) will be required. During the summer, November -j March, the surface must be stirred, preferably with discs, in the case of any heavy rain tending to form a surface crust. The crop will be put in v/ith the autumnal rains, May - June, and, in general, with the fifth stroke of the implements over the paddock, though instances of over twenty four strokes are not uncommon and v/ith corresponding profit*- After harvesting, the paddock is allowed to remain in stubble and grass for about sixteen months, v/hen it is again fallowed; thus one crop only is obtained in three years. In the meantime, the other portions of the farm are treated likewise, so that the farmer has v/ith the fallowing system one-third of his total area under crop each year. The average yield during the shoot-killing, or &quot;scratching&quot; period, is from six to eight bushels per acre. In the fallowing period, the average yield should be from twelve to eighteen bushels. It is essential, the first one or tv/o years perhaps excepted, to keep a flock of sheep to eat off the crop in winter, preventing it growing too rank. Under ordinary conditionst a 700-acre farm should run comfortably 150 sheep; attention should be particularly directed to the rearing of fat lambs for the market.

The value of unimproved Mallee land covered with scrub and without railway communication can hardly be stated in figures. It is, to all intents and purposes, worthless. In proximity tc a railway line - say, within &#9632; fifteen miles and with an&apos;assured water supply, its value in ordinary times, becomes from &#163;2.10s. to &#163;8 per acre.

            <essay:p>upon the passing of the Mallee Pastoral leases Act 1883, Under this act, Mallee lands on the &quot;fringe&quot; were classed as allotments: those further in were called &quot;blocks. leases expiring in 1903 were obtained by auction. ir. South Australia first had come the stripper, the Mullenlslng method of scrub clearing and cropping, the Mallee roller and the stump-viumTD slough, all South Australian inventions and of startling originality and of equally startling practical profit. The scrub was no longer a place to get lost in: fortunes were to be picked up without any outlay in particular of capital. The allotments were subdivided into holdings cf 500 to 1&#163;00 acres with a transferred tenure of balance of lease only. Such well-known names as David 31der, Isaac Younghusband, Pharez Phillips, Andrew Anderson and greatest of all, Sdward Harewood lascelles, were the leaders in settling these lands. Amending Acts were passed in 1885 and 1889. The Government urged to action by the private subdividers, started m 1888 and in three years, got rid of half a million aores, considerably in excess of the private results. The first bad drought - a very bad one - in 1902, halted the march. Some four million aores had been settled, and success&#172; fully. The &quot;fringe&quot; had gone. The &quot;interior belt , of close u-oon 2,000,000 acres of good wheat land and the &quot;Murray&quot; frontage&quot; of as many more, v/ere waiting.

Profiting by previous and some&#172; what bitter experience an effort was made to prevent, as far as possible, the considerable period of non-production usually*accompanying the early years of settlement, due to the natural difficulties caused by absence of railways, roads and v/ater supply.

Out of 103,000 acres thrown open and allotted in 1909 at &quot;Murrayville, no less than 55,000 acres wore under cultivation in 1910, yielding over 600,000 bushels. Bv 1919 the greater part of the &quot;interior belt&quot; had been subdivided, and a start made on the &quot;Murray frontage&quot;, Tho Hillewa area, 850,000 acres, served by the Red Cliffs- Meringur railway has been allocated; there remains nearly half a million acres of agricultural land - 200,000 in Hillewa, 90,000 at Pino Plains, 60,000 on the Cutlet Crook, and 150,000 in scattered portions. Altogether eight and a half million acres have been settled. Tho cost of thoso&apos; road and water supply works is actually defrayed by tho settlers. An addition of 3s. per acre was made to tho purchase price. Throe-fifths of this is sDont on roads and water supply in approximately equal portions. No charge is made for railways nor is any local rate charged. Complete and reliable schemes of water supply put in later are paid for by rates covering interest^depreciation, redemption, and working expenses; the average charge is &#163;15 per annum per square mile.

An examination of the records combined with some aboriginal traditions confirmed by observations of the first settlers shows a remarkable cyclical succession of v/et years. About tho beginning of each off decade, 1830.. 1850, 1870, 1890, 1910 - and it is to be hoped 1930 will not prove an exception, at any rate it has started well &#9632; thero occurs a sequence of four or five good seasons. Then there are sequences as long of indifferent or poor years with small runs of good seasons. The result of those sequences is during the run of good seasons to send up land prices above their true level and to convince the farmer that he is the beneficent agent and not the climate. Each good year is followed by a reduction in the area cropoed per farmer and what is worse, by a reduction in the quality of the cultivation, shown by a diminished yiold proportionately to the rainfall. The lean years have their value as they bring the farmer back to his bearings. Keeping in mind that bringing the scrub into production proceeded naturally from better conditions of soil and rainfall to the worst in Victoria, so that without an improvement in agricultural methods there should have been on the average a continual diminution as the poorer country was brought into subjection, the following figures of acreages and yields will repay some attention. First taking the last year of each decade since the Mallee was opened to the farmer in 1889.

Unfortunately though promises or half promises were made that the price would he maintained, the great slump came just before the harvesting of &quot;by far the greatest acreage ever sown to wheat in Victoria. The farmer had to accept what he could got, guarantee or no guarantee, and that was the lowest price known for neo,rly 40 years, a Drice that in all cases where the wheat was produced under a system of hired labour, was under the cost of production.

            <essay:p>each; 17 per cent of good years and 21 per cent of poor seasons. An undue proportion of the poor seasons occur in the early period 1889/1914 when the settlement was .almost wholly in the better soil and better rainfall areas* The effect of better methods of farming due to some extent also to the greater facilities afforded to the settler is reflected in the following figures: average yield from 1889 to 1914, 6i bushels: from 1915 to 1930, 10&#163; bushels.. It will be seen that the extension of settlement north&#172; wards into the area later termed &quot;The Newer Mallee&quot; did not have a harmful effect, quite the contrary* The necessity for some instruction of the new settlers, particularly the returned soldier settlers,often, nay mostly, devoid of any Mallee experience and indeed of either farming knowledge or aptitude, was forced on the Government. Experimental plots to demonstrate the best wheat varieties and the more profitable methods of cultivation were inaugurated. Supervisors, some at least with the requisite experience were appointed: but un&#172; fortunately their chief activities were connected with finance, and however grateful the appearance of the officer who is to make advances on improvements, may be, the feeling of indebtedness incurred and of future re&#172; payments has a repelling effect: and when he has to press for payments or has to refuse an application for an advance, the good understanding which must prevail if advice is to be given and taken, is destroyed and with it the supervisor&apos;s usefulness. To obtain good results from agricultural advisers, complete divorce from all financial matters is the first essential. The debt collector is never a welcome visitor. FINANCS - INITIAL CAPITAL. Investigations into the progress of so111 ernent made in 1915 showed that the average capital or as it may be better put, the average excess of assets over liabilities of the average settler on the interior Mallee blocks was a little under one hundred pounds. This was, in almost all cases, made up of waggon, implements, and teams, often in excess of the figure mentioned but set off by a fair amount of debts brought from his last attempt. To visualise properly the position of the Victorian Mallee settler, it Iris to be well realised that in this State, the Mallee country is the Cinderella of the rural districts, and it is not the resort of the farmer who has been successful elsewhere. It is somewhat different in the neighbouring State of South Australia which has a very large proportion of its rural areas on the margin line of surety. There the Mallee wheat areas which adjoin those of Victoria, being separated simply by an imaginary line, the 141st Meridian, are looked upon with favour and a farmer,</essay:p>

In this case, he is in a good financial position, and having learnt by hard experience, is generally found to retain .and improve thab position. Hence where Victorian Mallee areas have been thrown open adjoining South Australia their success has been over the average. FINAIICE - CAPITA! INVOLVED* However, the position is, the settler upon the virgin lands of the Mallee equipped with his hundred pounds, has now to face the problem of handling a business proposition involving at least four thousand pounds of capital. Tho Government assists by handing over to him at a nominal figure paid over a period&apos;of forty years without interest, some thousand acres. This may be taken to have a potential unimproved value of two pounds per acre* His minimum requirements in working and grazing stock, implements, material and sustenance for the earliest period in which he can obtain a return for his labour eighteen months, cannot be set down at loss than fifteen hundred pounds. Deferred outlay, for further clearing, house, sheds, fencing and water supply is on a very conservative estimate, five hundred to a thousand pounds. To meet all this, he possesses his paltry hundred pounds. His right or interest in the un&#172; improved value of his land is a non-negotiable one for the first six years during which he is simply a tenant of the Grown. True, he may acquire a valuable transferable interest by either insolvency or death; but not a personal one. Originally, that is prior to the repatriation movement subsequent to the return of our coldiers from the Great War the deficiency in capital was made up by private credit, not based upon the small capital brought in nor u-oon the hypothetical value of the block allotted the settler: but upon the settler himself. In other words, the private creditors, who embraced the storekeepers, the rolling contractors, the stock and station agents, the implement makers and the fertiliser firms, backed their judgment as to a man1s ability to make good by giving him credit. Naturally enough this implied dear money, that is dear to the settler: but in the long run highly profitable to the creditor. Yet it was accompanied by such a discriminative system of selection in the first place and in tho second place by such a rigid restriction of spending on the part of the farmer that it, m practice, proved quite successful and satisfactory. The substitution of a Government system of advances unaccompanied in uhc first Place by any drastic system of selection and after by severe restriction, has resulted in advances being</essay:p>

            <essay:p>looked upon as a right, and almost, it might be said, as remuneration, a credit instead of a debt. Evidently incurring debt is inevitable in the first two or three years of&apos;a Mallee settler1s career, but with a good or even a fair season or two, there should be no further burden, no millstone of debt around his neck. The investigation already referred to showed that the average settler had improved his position by somewhat over one hundred and fifty pounds yearly, and that at the end of his six years tutelary period he was worth eleven hundred pounds or one thousand more than he started with so that within that time he had got a good way on the job of accumulating the necessary capital to make his farm his own. This of course was not in cash but was represented by improvements to his farm by stock and by implements. The value, however, was there and in ordinary times readily realisable. Unfortunately, at the end Oi the six years, the farmer&apos;s title to his block became negotiable, advances on mortgage by banks, financial firms and trustees became possible: and rejoicing in the removal of the irksome restrictions of the past the farmer had a good time for a while. FINANCE - GENERAL. The later experience from 1919 onwards, of the substitution of a statutory and universal system of Government credit for the severe restriction oi private credit has not had the results that economical theories would lead one to expect. In place of cropping to provide some saleable product to bring in cash, much effort has been diverted to improvements, houses, sheds, fences, dams, and so on which however necessary and profitable in theory, have not helped to keep the farmer out of debt: but have actually landed him further in&gt; the mire. These results concomitantly with a succession of seasons below the average, some being disastrous, have led manv persons with a recent and superficial knowledge only to&apos;condemn Mallee settlement or at the best to class it as marginal or precarious. If land settlement be postponed in every case where a general economic survey made in the early stages throws doubt upon the possibilities of profitable production, there would have been no agricultural settlement in Northern Victoria. Even Victoria itself during the crisis of 1839-1841, when production was ten pounds per head and living costs over sixty, would have boon returned to King Jagga Jagga and abandoned; vet in 1848, prosperity was at a greater oitch than any period since. The same gloomy aeauctions and even blacker prophecies have been made of the Goulburn Valley, the loddon Plains and the Wimmcra country. Time has h^d its rovenge and nullified them .11.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>to buy sugar, coffee, tea and such things as washing soda though this last might have &quot;been done without had he known that his Mallee ashes would yield him potashes, or carbonate of potash, equally useful. As he produced 15,000 bushels and his other costs, sacks, fertiliser, rates, duplicates, etc., would not exceed &#163;650, his cost approximates to that of the Werrimuil figure. Near Huston&quot;in the Victorian Mallee, one farmer, a tractor one, crops and harvests 1000 acres without any assistance, Eis cost&apos;is in the same group. It will be seen that almost any figure may be made up by adding all sorts of quite legitimate charges. Yet in spite of these continued losses by production below cost, land values in rural Victoria steadily rose until they reached for v/heatgrowing land, absurdly high figures. In the Wirnmera where the three and four year rotation systems are in vogue, land sold steadily at from &#163;25 to &#163;30 per acre. After all, in the early period (1889-1914) of the Mallee, prosperity and a good solid prosperity at that was achieved with an average yield of 6i bushels per acre netting for the farmer 3/1^ aer bushel at the railway siding, just over one ^ound ^er acre as already stated. Since then d^- 19301 the vield has been 10i bushels and the price 4/4d. or &#163;2-5-6 tier acre. There certainly have been more motor cars, more^wireless sets and more luxury generally; but the ^resent low rjrice of wheat will call for much self- denial if the farmer is going to pull through. Whether he can pull through and cut his coat according to his cloth, will depend largely upon the lowering of &#8482;e prices of secondary products in a similar ratio to the primary ones. The old spirit is there, the trammels o&#177; legislation and doctrinaire administrators need casting off: that is all, 05ILBRAL. There are some miner difficulties connected with the bringing of virgin land into farming production. In the agricultural settlement of pastoral lands, a system of roads and road transport is already in existence, ana its extension or intension is all that is required. On the other hand, with virgin scrub, the construction ot a railway at the outset is imperative. As economical con&#172; siderations prevent railway construction being ahead o&#177; settlement, they have to proceed pari passu, Thisleaas to difficulties in the running of construction trams to time tables, the settler depending upon them ior his bread and meat. Once however the line is laid ana trie Lands Department has surveyed some township blocks, the Mallee storekeeper arrives on the scene. Y^Ty/CX3^ liJ thero a branch store of an old established tradesman further back. like the farmer, the Mallee storekeeper h_;o little capital though much confidence, which he apparently is able to inspire in the Flinders lane warehouseman also.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>In his store is stocked almost everything required from trace chains to tinned meats, the latest things in clothing and a groat variety of luxuries. Almost as soon open a fruit .and vegetable shop which generally caters also in an inefficient way for the inner man. The &quot;blacksmith lags a little as compared with the earlier days, when duplicates were not so common. Three things, almost essential, are not so easily procured. The first is a Justice of the Peace, as most of the pioneers have left transactions in course &quot;behind them, which require under tho British system much signing of stamped papers. The second is a hall for meetings, generally indignation ones, &quot;but also for social intercourse and the third and always the last is a bank. The tenure given under the existing laws is not a sufficient security to the conservative view of the Victorian banks. In South Australia, it is quite different. There a branch of the Bank of Adelaide is frequently the first building near a railway station. Other requirements are hotels, lawyers, and doctors. The hotel under the present licensing lav/, takes many years before its appearance becomes possible. Whatever its drawbacks, it is an improvement upon the wine saloon which precedes it. lluch may be said in favour of wine as a beverage: but not of the wine sold in these places nor of any wine as a means of getting drunk, for that is the general purpose of its consumption. Neither the lawyer nor the medical man can make a living until the pooulation is over 1200. Allowing one urban for each two rural dwellers, it calls for the settlement of over 150 farms or about 150,000 acres, about lour parishes as they run in Victoria. Government help towards the establishment of a medical man is withheld in this State. The Bush Nursing Association, a private enterprise has stepped into the breach, and has established what are virtually hospitals of quite a high order, although at times the doctor is far distant. No fault can be found with the Postal Depart&#172; ment which caters both for mails and telephones with a commendable promptitude. For some reason, it has never entered the official mind to load the township lands in the same way as the farms. If that had been done, a fund would have been created which would have provided the much needed public hall, in itself not a mean revenue producer, helped to make the streets traffickable and to provide a v/ater supply reticulation.

Much to the sur-orise of no less than six Shires, lawloit, Lowan Dimboola, Xarkarooc, Swan,Hill and LUldura, they found that settlement had taken place in their hinterlands, places absolutely inaccessible to their officials. Hatters carried on somehow or another for a year or two: then e soecial Act was passed creating a new body, the Walpeup Shire Council. The settlers, without municipal experience, responded to the call and very soon demonstrated that new ideas or perhaps, freedom from old shibboleths could be employed to the benefit of all.^ At any rote, no other part of the Mallee country, so quickly was favoured with good roads and urban conveniences. Ouyen forged ahead. With good streets and footpaths,_ electric lighting and sanitation, it became the principal town of the inner Mallee, outstripping all its older- settled competitors.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>CHINA&apos;S FOOD PROBLEM A STUDY OF SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION OF FOOD FOR 14 PROVINCES By C. C. Chang INTRODUCTION The purpose of this paper is to describe in quantitative terms China&apos;s supply and consumption of food by taking a sample of 14 provinces for which some reasonably approximate statistics are available. The description confines itself to only 14 provinces because even such approximate statistics are lacking for other parts of the country. It should be noted, however, that the 14 provinces considered here include the greater part of China&apos;s most important agricultural regions and have a population totalling up to nearly 280 million which is certainly over half of the entire country. For that reason the conclusions we arrive at from this study may fairly apply to the country as a whole. The basic data used in this study are almost entirely sup&#172; plied by the Bureau of Statistics Legislative Yuan, National Gov&#172; ernment of China. The nature and methods of collecting- such data will be explained as they are introduced. The provinces included in this study may be located in the attached map. I. FOOD SUPPLY OF 14 PROVINCES. China&apos;s food supply in recent years comes from two sources, native production and foreign imports. We shall first consider native production. A. Native Production of Food. Chinese statistics are rare in any field, but the carefully es&#172; timated figures on cultivated land and crops made by the Bureau</essay:p>

            <essay:p>of Statistics in the Legislative Yuan, at Nanking, may throw some Light on the question of food production in these 14 provinces. Since 1928 that Bureau has continually sent out simple ques&#172; tionaire blanks to hsien (county) magistrates, postmasters, school teachers and individual farmers to inquire about the population, land and crops of every hsien, in as many quantitative terms as the correspondents could reasonably answer. Among other things these blanks asked for the number of farm households, acreage of cultivated land, percentage of the cultivated land usually planted to each of the various crops, and the average rate of yield of each crop per unit of area in normal years. In these schedules the number of farm households and the acreage of cultivated land refer to the time of filling- the schedules but the crop acre&#172; age and crop yield refer to the average years. Thus the answers made at different months and years are fairly comparable. When these schedules came in one might find answers to some questions appearing to be wild guesses, but the question&#172; naire was made in such a way that the answers to important questions are counter-checked on the schedules themselves. For example, one question is asked about the total area of each hsien to insure that the cultivated land is not more than the entire area. The most common size of a farm area is also asked to check the accuracy of the total cultivated area. When the answered blanks came in their answers were check&#172; ed for obvious discrepancies and doubtful points wrere sent back for confirmation. Preliminary tabulation was then made for each item of inquiry and comparison was made between the figures on the blanks and those of other available sources. There were disagreements of course. To determine which figure re&#172; presents the actual fact was the most difficult thing; but by rely&#172; ing on the related facts such as topography, rainfall, temperature and density of population in and near a locality to which the figures refer one could select a figure that appears to be rather reasonable. Basing our study on information thus secured we shall examine the different aspects of food production in these 14 provinces.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>1. Acreage of cultivated land. The total area of these 14 provinces is 4,836 million mow or approximately one million square miles. The cultivated land totals up to 900 million mow or 18% of the entire area. The most important factor that determines the productivity of Chinese farm land excluding Man&#172; churia is irrigation. The irrigated land is more productive than the non-irrigated land. For that reason we ihave divided the cultivated land into two main groups, the irrigated and the non- irrigated. The acreage of the irrigated land is about 18% of the total cultivated land and the remaining 82% is not regularly irrigated. Of the 82% non-irrigated land 65% is on plains and the rest on hills. Details of these statistics may be observed from the following table: Table I. Total area and acreage of cultivated land of 14 provinces.

            <essay:p>In the above table the 14 provinces are grouped into North East, North, Central and Kwangtung regions, roughly based on similarities in agricultural conditions and density of population. This same grouping is followed throughout in other tables. Taking these provinces by regions the percentages of culti&#172; vated land to the total area are 9% for the North East, 37% for the North, 27% for the central and 11% for Kwangtung. One question that interests us in connection with the future food supply of China is how much of the 80% of non-cultivated land of these 14 provinces is economically suitable for cultivation and food production. There is no question that some of it can be profitably reclaimed but the extent of reclamation is certainly limited. In the North East region, especially Manchuria, it is not unreasonable to expect the percentage of cultivated land to go up as high as 20% of the total area but for the rest of these 14 provinces, and of China as a whole, it is highly improbable that the acreage of cultivated land will increase more than 5% of what we have already put under plough. It is true that one can see miles and miles of virgin prairies in some parts of China which may be profitably turned into grain fields, but such places are limited to a few localities only and their area is negligibly small compared with the land that has already been cultivated. On the other hand where one finds the presence of men there one can see cultivation taking place on steep hill sides and narrow river banks. Deserted farms are not rare in the hills of subtropical Kwangtung as well as on mountain ranges of semi-arid Kansu. All these observations seem to indicate that the food producing area of China will not increase to any great extent under the present method of cultiva&#172; tion. 2. Crop acreage. The following table II shows how much of the cultivated land is used for food crops and how much for crops of other uses. In the above table the acreage of each of the five classes of crops is shown. The food and feed crops include rice, wheat, barley, millet, kaoliang, corn, peas, etc. They do not include</essay:p>

            <essay:p>soybeans, because that crop is not used entirely for food. In the class of seeds for oil, soybeans, rape seeds, flax and sesamum are included. Other classes of crops need no explanation. The average annual acreage of all these crops totals up to 1,128 million mow, which is greater than the total acreage of the cultivated land because of double cropping in regions other than the North East. Food and feed crops share 80% of the total crop acreage; seeds for oil occupy 15.5%; and all the other classes of crops take up only 4.5%. 3. Acreage and production of food crops. Acreage and pro&#172; duction of each of the chief food crops are given in Table III by regions. According to the above table, taking the 14 provinces as a whole, wheat comes first in magnitude of acreage but rice leads in quantity of production. In general rice is planted in the irrigated and the best fields and much labor and fertilizers are applied to get the maximum yield per mow. Wheat is not so well treated. That, together with the difference in the natural yield in seed production of these crops, makes rice produce al&#172; most three times as much as wheat from the same unit of area. It explains why rice, occupying smaller acreage, produces a larger quantity of food material. 4. Net supply of food from different crops. The above table which we have just reviewed only gives the gross produc&#172; tion of various food crops. It does not represent the net food supply derived from them. Some of the crops produced must be used in part or wholly as feeds. From every crop a part of the annual production must be taken out to provide seeds to pro&#172; duce the following year&apos;s crop. The portion that remains avail&#172; able for human food must be processed before it is consumed. In processing some of the foodstuffs go to waste, as for example. hulls of rice and bran of flour. The net supply of food, there&#172; fore, is the gross production less the quantities necessary for feed, seed, and wastes in processing. The table following gives the gross production and the net supply of food from various crops of the 14 provinces- (Table IV)</essay:p>

            <essay:p>In the above table seeds feeds and milling wastes are sub&#172; tracted from each of the food crops and the remainder is con&#172; sidered as the available quantity for human consumption or net supply of food. In order to make the quantity of one crop com&#172; parable to that of another each crop is expressed in terms of rice equivalent calculated on the basis of the fuel value of each crop in proportion to that of middle grade of rice.(1) Quantities of feed required by each province are taken out from such crops as the farmers ordinarily use in that province. According to the above table the total supply of food of all the 17 chief crops amounts to 107,438, million catties or 143,216 million pounds per year of rice equivalent. Rice, wheat, kaoliang, millet and corn make up about 85% of the total supply. The remaining 20% is distributed among 12 minor crops as the table shows. In the table we have not included soybeans because this crop is largely used for industrial purposes. But it is well known that some of this crop is also directly consumed as human food. To find the total food supply it seems necessary to include some of that crop. The gross production of soybeans in million catties per year by provinces and regions is as follows: Heilungkiang 2,293 Hupeh 787 Kirin 3,818 Anhwei 1,070 Liaoning 2,488 Kiangsu 2.295 Jehol 184 Chekiang 348 Chahar 109 Central 4,500 North East 8,892 Kwangtung 199 Shansi 267 Hopei 1,119 Honan 1,474 Shantung 3,484 North 6,344 Total 19,935 (!) The fuel value of each crop is after the analysis of Dr. H. Wu, Peking Union Medical College, China Journal of Physiology, report series 1928, No. 1. pp. 153-186.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Of the 8,892 million catties of soybeans produced in the North East Provinces about 3,500&apos; million catties are exported, 3,000 million catties abroad and 500 million catties to other parts of China. The remainder is used as seed, feed and for in&#172; dustrial purposes. The amount that goes to direct food con&#172; sumption must be very negligible compared with the gross pro&#172; duction. For that reason we shall not include any soybeans in our calculation of total food supply for this region. Utilization of soybeans in other provinces is different. More than 90% of the gross production goes to domestic consumption. It is hard to say, however, how much of it goes to sup&#172; ply human food and how much is used for industries. Not going into detailed discussion on this question for lack of information we shall arbitrarily take 40% of the gross production as the portion that is used directly as human food, for regions other than the North East. On that basis the amount of human food supplied by soybeans for three regions is as follows: Provinces and regions Gross production in million catties 40% of gross production in million catties Rice equivalent of 40% of gross production in million catties* Hon an Shansi Hopei Shantung 1,474 267 1,119 3,484 590 107 448 1,394 693 126 526 1,638 North 6,344 2,538 2,983 Hupeh Anhwei Kiangsu Chekiang 787 1,070 2,295 348 314 428 918 139 369 504 1,079 163 Central 4,500 1,801 2,115 Kwangtung 199 80 94 Grand Total 11,043 4417 5,192 * Rice equivalent of soybeans is taken as 1.175</essay:p>

            <essay:p>When this amount is added to the amount of food supplied by 17 chief crops, the total food supply from domestic sources for 14 provinces becomes 112,630 million catties of rice equiv&#172; alent. B. Imports and Exports of Food Stuff&apos;s The chief food stuffs that come into China&apos;s foreign trade are rioe, wheat, wheat flour, kaoliang, millet and corn. The average annual imports and exports of these food stuffs through all ports of China for 1926-1929 are as follows: Articles Exports Imports (1,000 piculs (i) ) (1,000 piculs U&gt; ) Millet ........................ 5,312 .............. Kaoliang ..................... 1,459 .............. Wheat........................ 776 .............. 3,180 Corn........................ 466 .............. Flour ........................ 87 .............. 6,506 Rice......................... 43.........,___15,766 In terms of rice equivalent all exports amounted to about 814 million catties, and all imports 2,538 million catties. Imports over exports amounts to 1,724 million catties of rice equivalent. When this balance is added to the total food supply we have a total amount of 118,532 million catties in rice equivalenti. The sources of this supply may be summarized as follows : A. Home production Million Catties 1. 17 chief food crops .............................. 107,438 2. 40% of gross production of soybeans for 3 regions 9,370 B. Foreign Imports over Exports ........................ 1724 Total ...................................... 118,532 C. Per Capita Food Supply The total population of the 14 provinces as far as we could determine is about 278 million persons. Basing on the above estimates of the total food supply, the average annual per capita supply becomes 426 catties or 568 pounds. That gives a fuel value of 2,307 calories per person per day.

            <essay:p>U. FOOD CONSUMPTION How much food is normally required by these 14 provinces in a year is the question that we attempt to answer in this section. To answer this question two factors must be known, the total population and the average food requirement per person. We shall consider the second factor first. Average amount of food required by an average&apos; Chinese person per day. On the average food requirement of a Chinese person, some studies have been made in the past. The results of some well known studies may be tabulated here.

            <essay:p>From the above table one finds that the fuel value required by an adult male per day varies somewhere from 2600 to 3500 calories. We do not know which is the best figure to take, but one thing stands out clearly, that the proportion of fuel value derived from cereal products is much higher than that supplied by other kinds of food. This is more conspicuous in the case of farm diet. Professor Buck&apos;s results show a proportion of 90% and Mr. Yashnoff&apos;s 97% of the fuel value supplied by cereal products. The working people in the cities get a larger proportion of their fuel value from other foods than the farmers. It seems safe to say that from 90 to 95% of the nutritive value of the diet of most people in the Northern provinces are obtained from cereal pro&#172; ducts. In the South more variety is found but still the larger por&#172; tion, from 80 to 95% of the nutritive value comes from cereals and tubers. This condition simplifies the method of studying Chinese food requirement. If one can get a fair idea of the average cereal requirement, one has the large part of the food demand deter&#172; mined. Under the auspices of the Bureau of Statistics of the Legis&#172; lative Yuan, the author conducted a study of the average daily re&#172; quirement of rice per person in the fall of 1930. Two samples were taken, one in the country about 15 miles east of Nanking and another in a small town about 10 miles south of the same city. In the country district, 2389 persons answered their inquiries and in the town 2047 persons responded. The coun&#172; try people are those of the farm families. The towns people are from the families of businessmen, handicraft men, and school teach&#172; ers. The method of investigation may be sketched briefly. A blank schedule was used for each family to be investigated. In the schedule, five items were asked of each person of the family, namelly (1) relation to head of family, (2) sex, (3) age, (4) occupa&#172; tion and (5) number of bowls of cooked rice ordinarily consumed per day. For the entire family this question was asked : &quot;How many catties of uncooked rice are needed per day for preparing enough cooked rice for all members in the family if they all take their meals at home?&quot; Answers to this question give the total quantity of rice</essay:p>

            <essay:p>consumed by all members and the amount consumed by each mem&#172; ber is apportioned according to the number of bowls he or she takes. For example, one family has 4 members. The total amount of rice consumed in a day is 4.5 catties. The four members give the following answers: Relation to head of family Sex Age No. of bowls of rice consumed Bigd) Small Equivalent to oz. of uncooked rice (calculated) Head of family Wife Son Daughter male female male female 49 45 19 15 3 0 4 0 0 4 0 6 18 12 24 18 Total 10 72 The four members consume in all 7 big bowls and 10 small bowls of cooked rice which was made from 4.5 catties or 72 oz. of uncooked rice. Since one big bowl contains twice the amount of one small bowl the head of the family consumed 6 small bowls and the son 8 small bowls. That makes a total of ( 6+8+4+6&apos;) 24 small bowls of uncooked rice for the entire family. These 24 bowls of cooked rice were prepared from 72 oz. of uncooked rice and therefore one small bowl of cooked rice is equal to three oz. That makes the daily consumption of uncooked rice for the four members as follows: Head of family 6 x 3=18 oz. Wife 4 x 3=12 &#8222; Son 8 x 3=24 &#8222; Daughter 6 x 3=18 ,, Total 72 oz. or 4.5 catties The above example illustrates the underlying principle of the questionaire and the method of calculation. The blank schedules were filled by an investigator of long experience. The results were sorted according to sex and age. For persons in each one-year age group of either sex an average was calculated for the daily requirement. These one-year (!) One big bowl equals two small bowls in capacity.</essay:p>

Figures not starred represent the points on smoothed curves of the original data,. Tendencies shown in the above table may be more clearly observed in the chart on the opposite page. According tO; this chart the country folk require more rice than the town people and men eat more than women. Under 15 and above 65 years of age such differences are not very notice&#172; able but between these limits they are considerable. We shall not discuss the obvious reasons for such differences but one thing should be mentioned here. Ordinarily the diet of the farmers con&#172; sists of a larger proportion of cereals than that of the town people. Meats, fish and even leafy vegetables are not always available on Chinese farms. They have to be bought in markets under ordinary (!) The Chinese way of reckoning age is usually one year more than the actual age. Therefore the original Chinese ages were reduced by one year, thus (0-4) and (5-9) represent (1-5) and (6-10) in Chinese ages.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>circumstances. It is often beyond the Chinese farmer&apos;s means to buy such things. Since this investigation studies only the cereal portion of a diet the farmer must require more rice than the person of the town. No matter what the reason is for such differences we must take into consideration the age and sex composition of the particular population for which the average per capita food requirement is to be calculated. It is also obvious that the farm population must be treated separately from the city population. This complicates our problem. A simple way of getting away from this difficulty may be to find two averages for both farm and town population. Average per capita daily food requirement of farm population: To find the average per capita daily food requirement of the farm population we need to know the age distribution of the normal Table VI.

            <essay:p>population. We have to use the results of a sample study on this point made by Professor C. M. Chiao and Professor J. F. Buck. (1) Using the age distribution calculated by Chiao and Buck and the food requirement of each age group obtained from the study made by the Bureau of Statistics, we have the following table: In this table we have taken 100 persons of either sex of normal age distribution; weighting the average rice requirement of each age group by its number of persons we obtain as an average for farm males, 23.31 Chinese ounces and for farm females, 20.38 ounces of rice per day. In terms of grams the daily rice requirement ment of a man is 823 grams and that of a woman is 720 grams. That gives a fuel value of 2905 calories for man and 2540 calories for woman. The average woman in the country requires about 88% of the amount that is required by a man. Table VII. Average per capita daily requirement of rice of city population.

Using those data and the results of the daily food requirement studied by the same Bureau we have the following table: According to the above table the daily rice requirement of a city man is 18.19 Chinese ounces and that of a woman is 15.84 ounces. In terms of grams the city male requires 642 grams and the female, 559 grams. That gives a fuel value of 2266 calories, and 1974 calories per day for city man and city woman respectively. The city woman requires about 87% of the amount of rice that is required by a city man. The foregoing results may be summarized as follows: Daily requirement Persons In local Chinese ounces t1) In catties &lt;2) In grams In calories (3) Country male City male City female 23.31 20.38 18.19 15.84 1.372 823 1.200 720 1.070 559 0.932 559 2906&apos; 25.42 2266 1974 In the above table it may be observed that the average man on the farm requires about 20% more rice than the man in the city; the farm women requires also about 20% more than the city woman. On the basis of these results we shall proceed to find out how much food is normally required by these 14 provinces. Total food requirement of the 14 provinces. To determine the total food requirement of these provinces we have to deal with the much disputed question of the number of the Chinese popula&#172; tion. How many people are there in these provinces? We must (!) One local Chinese ounce is 35.31 grams. (2) One catty=600 grams.

Among the 14 provinces under our present consideration eight had population census re&#172; turns for the number of males and females for 1928. The remaining six provinces have reported their estimated numbers of households but not numbers of persons. The method we use to obtain the number of persons of a province (which does not give the numbers of persons) is to multiply the number of households by the average number of persons per household of the neighboring province or provinces. Thus the total number of persons in Kirin Province is obtained by multiplying Kirin&apos;s total number of household, 1,260,907, by the 6.67, which is the average number of persons per household of Liaoning Province, a near neighbor to Kirin. The product 8,410,250 is taken as the total population of Kirin. It is a rough estimate but that seems to be the best that wte can do. The following table gives the population by regions and provinces: In the above table we have assumed that the number of persons per farm household is equal to that of the city household. Observation shows, however, that the city household has a smaller number of persons than the farm household. If this observation is correct the above table shows too large a population for citiesr and too small a one for the country. Since the city people require considerably smaller amount of rice than the country folks our calculation of total food requirement based on the above popula&#172; tion estimates will give a smaller figure than it should be. No attempt is made to correct that error. We can only ask our readers to give due attention to that point. The total annual food requirement of each province is cal&#172; culated by multiplying the number of each class of population by the average amount of the annual per capita rice requirement of that class. The results of these calculations are shown in the table below:</essay:p>

            <essay:p>According to the above table the 14 provinces normally need 124,565 million catties or 83 million short tons of rice or rice equivalent per annum. The total supply of food including the excess of imports over exports as we have already calculated is 118,532 million catties or 79 million short tons. The supply of food therefore is about four million tons or 5% less than the estimated requirement. If our data were all absolutely reliable and our methods of calculation all justified, this 5% difference in supply and demand would mean that the population of these provinces are underfed to that degree. But that cannot be the case. As we have explained in the preceding pages it is not at all strange to find our data 10% too high or too low for the real facts. Our results should Table X.

            <essay:p>not be taken as more refined than that limit. The only conclusion it seems safe to draw is that in normal crop years these pro&#172; vinces have just about enough food supply. Having determined the production and the requirement of food it is a simple matter to find out which provinces and regions have sufficient supply and which insufficient. This may be observ&#172; ed from the following table. In the above table it is clearly shown that the provinces in the North East Region produce more food than their populations require. Shansi, Hupeh and Kiangsu are self-sufficient. All other provinces are definitely deficient in their food production. Among the deficient provinces Kwangtung stands at the top. Her pro&#172; duction can support only two thirds of her population; the other one third must be fed with imported food stuffs. For the North Region the deficient amount of food is about 20% of the total requirement; the same kind of figure for the central region is 10%. Taking all these provinces as a whole and balancing up the total amount of deficiency by that of surplus wre still have a deficiency of 12,000 million catties of rice or rice equivalent per year, forming about 8% of the total requirement. The foregoing statements may not express the exact amount of food deficiency or surplus of each province but the tendencies they show cannot be far wrong. To prove this we may introduce some figures on exports and imports of foodstuffs through im&#172; portant ports. For the years 1926-1929, the average annual ex&#172; ports and imports of foodstuffs (both domestic and international are as follows:</essay:p>

We may also remind the reader that the vast number (500,000 to 1,000,000) of people who emigrate to the North East Pro&#172; vinces every year are mostly from the North region.

In the 14 provinces studied, rice, wheat, kaoliang, millet and corn are the most important food crops. They make up about 85% of the total food supply. 3. The total annual supply of food is 118,532 million catties in rice equivalent. Of that quantity the supply coming from foreign countries, after balancing up with food exports, is less than two percent. 4. The average annual per capita food supply is estimated at about 426 catties or 568 pounds in rice equivalent. 5. The total consumption of food based on the estimated popula&#172; tion (278 millions) of these provinces is 124,565 million catties in rice equivalent. 6. When supply is compared with consumption requirements the former is about 5% less than the latter. 7. Among the four regions, the North East produces more food than it consumes. The other regions are not producing enough food for their population.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>A STUDY OF CORRELATION BETWEEN FACTORS OF PRODUCTION AND THE YIELDS OF ARABLE LAND The following may be said to be the principal factors that are responsible for the differences in productivity due to the loca&#172; tion and the utilization of arable land in Japan: (1) Natural factors such as topographical, geological and climatic. (2) Industrial factors. (a) The degree of intensity of labor and of labor technique. (b) The degree of intensity of capital. ( i) The amount and method of current invest&#172; ment: the degree of intensity and technique in the application of fertilizers and farm implements. (ii) The amount and method of previous funda&#172; mental investment: capital aready put into the arable land in order to increase its pro&#172; ductivity. (3) Social-economic factors such as: (a) the size of markets. (b) the distance between the farm and the market. (c) the means of transportation available. The interdependence of these main factors is a deciding factor in the utilization and productivity of arable land. It must be noted that factors in (1): and (3) are, when viewed from the standpoint of industrial management, given a priori. &apos; The factor (2) can be artificially modified only in relation to the other two factors, namely, (1) and (3). We shall take these two other factors in</essay:p>

            <essay:p>the present condition in our country as given facts, in the present inquiry into the correlations between the various factors of agricul&#172; tural management and both the form of utilization and yields of arable land. Let us first classfy the different grades of labor intensity which may be applied to a given kind of arable land, and then calculate respectively according to that classification the average amount of yield per tan of the arable land. We will then find the total field of all the arable lands in the entire country having the same inten&#172; sity of labor. In this calculation, we may consider that all other factors in each kind of arable land have been distributed equally. We can thus learn the amount of yield per tan that corresponds to each grade of labor intensity. We may then calculate the relation between the amount of labor put into arable land and the crop yield. The same process of investigation will show the correlations between the amount of fertilizer put into arable land and its yield. The correlations between the depth of ploughing, which depends on such a factors as the nature of the soil and the amount of labor expended, and the productivity, of the land. By this method, we can study the importance which each of such factors of agricultural management as the amount of labor, fertilizers, and the depth of the ploughing bears to the differences of yield in this country. The following is the result of our investigation. A. Correlations Between the Amount of Fertilizers Put into Land and the Yield The amount and quality of fertilizer has a direct and import&#172; ant relationship to the productivity of the crop. We shall find their correlation co-efficient. The results found on Table I, Dia&#172; gram I, and the correlation co-efficient r=.0.81, were found as regards paddy fields by using the above described method. We have also secured as regards upland fields the information con&#172; tained on Table II, Diagram II, and the correlation co-efficient r=0.90. This explains how the yield from paddy fields and upland fields in our country depends on the amount of fertilizer used. In view of the facts that the materials used are unsatisfactory</essay:p>

            <essay:p>Why is it then that this general rule does not apply in this case? It is because of the peculiar agricultural circumstances which exist in Japan, that is: (1) In this country some paddy fields are situated in deep muddy places often reaching several feet in depth. Such paddy fields, which are called &quot;Fuketa,&quot; by the nature of things, make deep ploughing invitable. It is impossible to carry on both irriga&#172; tion and drainage properly, and therefore such paddy fields are wet throughout the entire year. They exist in mountain valleys and other places where under-ground water runs on high levels. (2) Moreover, our one sided rice diet plays a peculiar role in this respect. Our farmers raise rice even where no ordinary means of irrigation exist. In such cases, the land is ploughed deeply so that more water may be absorbed. In order to hold sufficient water for the summer rice culture, no drainage is made even during the winter months. Therefore they are wet throughout the year. In these unfavorable paddy field it is not possible to adjust the irrigation, a factor which is most important in raising rice. The water is always coldj its circulation is\ badj and the dirt of the paddyfields is not exposed to the air. The results are that the rice roots are not sufficiently stimulated and the dissolution of fertilizers is imperfect. Therefore it is inevitable that the crop is poor. Because of these peculiar agricultural circumstances in Japan, it cannot be said that rice paddies taken as a whole may yield more because they are ploughed deeper. TABLE III.

Correlations between the Depth of Ploughing and the Yield in the Case of Upland Fields on which Rotated Cultivation of Barley and Sweet Potatoes is Practiced Depth of Plough No. of Answers Average Yields per Tan &#165; 2 40.5 35 62.9 4 to 6 &#8222; ......... 28 4 69.1 6 to 8 &#8222; ......... 76.0 8 to 10 &#8222; ......... 2 86.0 C. Correlations Between the Amount of Labor Used and the Yield of Arable Land It is generally conceded that the greater the intensification of labor, the more will be the yield of arable land. But our investiga&#172; tion into the raising of rice on paddy fields embodied in Table V and Diagram V shows the correlation coefficient r = 0.26, thus showing that where -the large amount of labor is used the size of the crop is not necessarily large. The result of the investiga&#172; tion in the case of the upland fields where barley and sweet potatoes are raised alternatively gives r=0.49 (Table VI and Diagram VI). The reasons for these correlations being so extremely limited needs explanation. A study of paddy fields reveals two fundamental reasons: (a) Because of Japanese one-sided rice diet, farmers raise rice even where its cultivation is greatly handicapped. This means that often in the cultivation of this cereal, the crop hardly justifies the amount of labor required. (b) Labor surplus in our agricultural villages. Labor is more plentiful than all the other factors of production in our farm management and is therefore incredibly cheap. Work which could be more efficiently performed by either beasts of burden or im-</essay:p>

            <essay:p>both quantitatively and qualitatively and the method of inquiry too sweeping to be absolutely reliable, the results of this study are by no means complete. The methods used, however, have been the best that are available. Moreover, the amount of fertilizer affects the yield with mathematical precision only when all other factors are equal and when the fertilizers themselves are of the same definite quality. By &quot;quality&quot; is meant not only all of the three organic and other content but also their inter-relations, the speed of their dissolution, and the time of application. As I have explained elsewhere (on the irrationality in the use of fertilizers), there is a deep and complicated defect in the method of using fertilizers in our country at present. It often happens that plants are injured by the wrong use of fertilizers. The amount of yield may even be reduced instead of increased. Nor does this defect seem to apply in the same way everywhere. The results of the investigation will be satisfactory if it reveals in a rough outline the correlations between the amount of fertilizer and the yield under the present management of arable land in this country.

Correlations between the Average Amount of Fertilizer Applied and the Annual Yield in Value in the Case of Upland Fields on which Rotated Cultivation of Barley and Sweet Potatoes is Practiced Cases Average Yield per Tan &#165; 6 44.8 10 48.8 22 73.8 19 59.6 15 80.2 6 84.7 &#165; less than 5.9 6 to 99 10 to 13 9 14 to 179 18 to 21.9 22 to 25,9 B. Correlations Between the Depth of Ploughing and the Amount of Yield of Arable Land in our Country The correlations in the case of paddy fields are shown in Table III and Diagram III. The results of our investigation show that the depth of ploughing does not bear any necessary relationship to the amount of the crop. The correlation co-efficient r = 0.29 indicates that there is no connection between them. This however, has nothing to do with the case where a different depth of plough&#172; ing is practised on the same land. As a general proposition, it is undeniable that the greater the depth of the ploughing, the more will be the amount of the crop. When land is ploughed deeper, a more satisfactory amount of water and nurishment can be had and the growth of t&apos;he roots will be promoted. The writer has al&#172; ready discussed this in his &quot;Examples of the Effects Deep Plough&#172; ing Has on the Productivity of Arable Land&quot; and &quot;Conditions Responsible for Maximum Production&quot; (given in Table IV and Diagram IV). This is also seen in the result of another in&#172; vestigation which showed that where the rotated cultivation of barley and sweet potatoes is practiced in upland fields the correla&#172; tion coefficient r=0.96 existed between the depth of ploughing and the yield (given in Table IV and Diagram IV).</essay:p>

            <essay:p>plements is largely done by men. And therefore, in some districts, there are cases where, from the standpoint of labor efficiency, human labor is simply wasted. This is further demonstrated by the fact that the productivity of arable land in the districts near cities and towns is higher than the average of the whole country, in spite of the comparatively smaller amount of labor expended in agriculture. This is true because the greater demand for and higher price of labor result in a higher efficiency. This is shown as follows: (Beasts of burden and implements are used to a lesser degree in urban districts where farming is on a comparatively small scale than is true of more rural sections,). Average Yield Number of Per Tan ^in Koku) Men engaged Average of 37 urban districts in Japan ................... 2.41 20 Average of 370 rural districts. . . . 2.39 22 It may therefore be said that the Japanese paddy fields show the highest productive efficiency in the world, chiefly because of the abundance of labor. However, we cannot say that the local differences in yield under present paddy conditions of Japan is con&#172; trolled by the amount of labor expended. The same condition of an over supply of labor is also true of upland fields. Where there is scarcity of labor, all labor newly applied be&#172; comes effective, and the amount of output varies with the amount of labor available. Under such circumstances, the rationalization of agricultural management may be attained by the greater applica&#172; tion of machinery and the use of beasts of burden. But where there exists a sort of surplus labor, as in our country today&#8212;there is an undoubted surplus of labor in the raising of rice&#8212;and where labor is a surplus element in the &quot;law of minimum,&quot; all sorts of labor will be reduced in its efficiency. The greater the amount of labor surplus, the lower will be the efficiency of the labor unit. As the labor surplus decreases, labor efficiency increases. Viewed from the standpoint of the rationalization of agricultural manage&#172; ment, it is often possible that, unless the types of farming are radically altered, the employment of beasts of burden or the use of machinery would result in a higher cost than when man power only is utilized.</essay:p>

            <essay:p>The existence of an agricultural industry that depends solely on human labor such as we have in our country today is the inevit&#172; able result of a labor surplus rather than of an ignorance or ineffi&#172; ciency of the farmers. Thus, in this country, the amount of labor power has ceased to have any special influence upon the output of farms. Of course, the quality of labor (skill and technical knowledge) still retains its great significance, but this question cannot be discussed here. There is one more point to be mentioned. So far we have discussed only cases having the same types of farming. There would be a different picture, if the types of farming or the utiliza&#172; tion of arable land could be changed. By increasing the number of rotation crops, or by changing the plant raised, a stated area in a given district could absorb more labor. There is a vast pos&#172; sibility in this country of increasing the output per tan by changing the farm organization, and thereby adjusting the seasonal distri&#172; bution of labor required.
